5,5,0,Matt,1005,"Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,"
6,6,0,Matt,1006,and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.

16,16,0,Matt,1016,"And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ."
17,17,0,Matt,1017,"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations."
18,18,0,Matt,1018,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."
19,19,0,Matt,1019,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly."
20,20,0,Matt,1020,"But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
21,21,0,Matt,1021,"And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.&rdquo;"

23,23,0,Matt,1023,"&ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which is translated, &lsquo;God with us.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24,24,0,Matt,1024,"Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,"
25,25,0,Matt,1025,and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.
26,26,0,Matt,2001,"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,"
27,27,0,Matt,2002,"saying, &ldquo;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.&rdquo;"
28,28,0,Matt,2003,"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
29,29,0,Matt,2004,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born."
30,30,0,Matt,2005,"So they said to him, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:"
31,31,0,Matt,2006,"&lsquo;But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, Are not the least among the rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
32,32,0,Matt,2007,"Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared."
33,33,0,Matt,2008,"And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, &ldquo;Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.&rdquo;"
34,34,0,Matt,2009,"When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was."
35,35,0,Matt,2010,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy."
36,36,0,Matt,2011,"And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh."
37,37,0,Matt,2012,"Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way."
38,38,0,Matt,2013,"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.&rdquo;"
39,39,0,Matt,2014,"When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt,"
40,40,0,Matt,2015,"and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, &ldquo;Out of Egypt I called My Son.&rdquo; "
41,41,0,Matt,2016,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men."
42,42,0,Matt,2017,"Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:"
43,43,0,Matt,2018,"&ldquo;A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.&rdquo;"
44,44,0,Matt,2019,"Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
45,45,0,Matt,2020,"saying, &ldquo;Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child&rsquo;s life are dead.&rdquo;"
46,46,0,Matt,2021,"Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel."
47,47,0,Matt,2022,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee."
48,48,0,Matt,2023,"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, &ldquo;He shall be called a Nazarene.&rdquo;"
49,49,0,Matt,3001,"In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,"
50,50,0,Matt,3002,"and saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!&rdquo;"
51,51,0,Matt,3003,"For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: &ldquo;The voice of one crying in the wilderness: &lsquo;Prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
52,52,0,Matt,3004,"Now John himself was clothed in camel&rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey."
53,53,0,Matt,3005,"Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him"
54,54,0,Matt,3006,"and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins."
55,55,0,Matt,3007,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, &ldquo;Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
56,56,0,Matt,3008,"Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance,"
57,57,0,Matt,3009,"and do not think to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham as our father.&rsquo; For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
58,58,0,Matt,3010,And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
59,59,0,Matt,3011,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. "
60,60,0,Matt,3012,"His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;"
61,61,0,Matt,3013,Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.
62,62,0,Matt,3014,"And John tried to prevent Him, saying, &ldquo;I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?&rdquo;"
63,63,0,Matt,3015,"But Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&rdquo; Then he allowed Him."
64,64,0,Matt,3016,"When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him."
65,65,0,Matt,3017,"And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo;"
66,66,0,Matt,4001,Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
67,67,0,Matt,4002,"And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry."
68,68,0,Matt,4003,"Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&rdquo;"
69,69,0,Matt,4004,"But He answered and said, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
70,70,0,Matt,4005,"Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,"
71,71,0,Matt,4006,"and said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: &lsquo;He shall give His angels charge over you,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
72,72,0,Matt,4007,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;It is written again, &lsquo;You shall not tempt the LORD your God.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
73,73,0,Matt,4008,"Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory."
74,74,0,Matt,4009,"And he said to Him, &ldquo;All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.&rdquo;"
75,75,0,Matt,4010,"Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Away with you, Satan! For it is written, &lsquo;You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
76,76,0,Matt,4011,"Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him."
77,77,0,Matt,4012,"Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee."
78,78,0,Matt,4013,"And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
79,79,0,Matt,4014,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:"
80,80,0,Matt,4015,"&ldquo;The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:"
81,81,0,Matt,4016,"The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death Light has dawned.&rdquo; "
82,82,0,Matt,4017,"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo;"
83,83,0,Matt,4018,"And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen."
84,84,0,Matt,4019,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo;"
85,85,0,Matt,4020,They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
86,86,0,Matt,4021,"Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them,"
87,87,0,Matt,4022,"and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him."
88,88,0,Matt,4023,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people."
89,89,0,Matt,4024,"Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them."
90,90,0,Matt,4025,"Great multitudes followed Him &ndash; from Galilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan."
91,91,0,Matt,5001,"And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him."
92,92,0,Matt,5002,"Then He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:"
93,93,0,Matt,5003,"&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
94,94,0,Matt,5004,"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
95,95,0,Matt,5005,"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
96,96,0,Matt,5006,"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."
97,97,0,Matt,5007,"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
98,98,0,Matt,5008,"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
99,99,0,Matt,5009,"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."
100,100,0,Matt,5010,"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
101,101,0,Matt,5011,"Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake."
102,102,0,Matt,5012,"Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
103,103,0,Matt,5013,"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."
104,104,0,Matt,5014,You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
105,105,0,Matt,5015,"Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house."
106,106,0,Matt,5016,"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."
107,107,0,Matt,5017,Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.
108,108,0,Matt,5018,"For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled."
109,109,0,Matt,5019,"Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
110,110,0,Matt,5020,"For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."
111,111,0,Matt,5021,"You have heard that it was said to those of old, &lsquo;You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.&rsquo;"
112,112,0,Matt,5022,"But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, &lsquo;Raca!&rsquo; shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, &lsquo;You fool!&rsquo; shall be in danger of hell fire."
113,113,0,Matt,5023,"Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
114,114,0,Matt,5024,"leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
115,115,0,Matt,5025,"Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."
116,116,0,Matt,5026,"Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny."
117,117,0,Matt,5027,"You have heard that it was said to those of old, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rsquo; "
118,118,0,Matt,5028,But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
119,119,0,Matt,5029,"If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell."
120,120,0,Matt,5030,"And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell."
121,121,0,Matt,5031,"Furthermore it has been said, &lsquo;Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.&rsquo;"
122,122,0,Matt,5032,"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery."
123,123,0,Matt,5033,"Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, &lsquo;You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.&rsquo;"
124,124,0,Matt,5034,"But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God&rsquo;s throne;"
125,125,0,Matt,5035,"nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King."
126,126,0,Matt,5036,"Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black."
127,127,0,Matt,5037,"But let your &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; be &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and your &lsquo;No,&rsquo; &lsquo;No&rsquo;. For whatever is more than these is from the evil one."
128,128,0,Matt,5038,"You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.&rsquo; "
129,129,0,Matt,5039,"But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also."
130,130,0,Matt,5040,"If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also."
131,131,0,Matt,5041,"And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two."
132,132,0,Matt,5042,"Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away."
133,133,0,Matt,5043,"You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo;"
134,134,0,Matt,5044,"But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, "
135,135,0,Matt,5045,"that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
136,136,0,Matt,5046,"For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
137,137,0,Matt,5047,"And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so?"
138,138,0,Matt,5048,"Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
139,139,0,Matt,6001,"Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven."
140,140,0,Matt,6002,"Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward."
141,141,0,Matt,6003,"But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,"
142,142,0,Matt,6004,"that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly. "
143,143,0,Matt,6005,"And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward."
144,144,0,Matt,6006,"But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. "
145,145,0,Matt,6007,"And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words."
146,146,0,Matt,6008,Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.
147,147,0,Matt,6009,"In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name."
148,148,0,Matt,6010,Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
149,149,0,Matt,6011,Give us this day our daily bread.
150,150,0,Matt,6012,"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
151,151,0,Matt,6013,"And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. "
152,152,0,Matt,6014,"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
153,153,0,Matt,6015,"But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
154,154,0,Matt,6016,"Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward."
155,155,0,Matt,6017,"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,"
156,156,0,Matt,6018,"so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. "
157,157,0,Matt,6019,"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal;"
158,158,0,Matt,6020,"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal."
159,159,0,Matt,6021,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
160,160,0,Matt,6022,"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light."
161,161,0,Matt,6023,"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"
162,162,0,Matt,6024,"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."
163,163,0,Matt,6025,"Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?"
164,164,0,Matt,6026,"Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"
165,165,0,Matt,6027,Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?
166,166,0,Matt,6028,"So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;"
167,167,0,Matt,6029,and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
168,168,0,Matt,6030,"Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
169,169,0,Matt,6031,"Therefore do not worry, saying, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we wear?&rsquo;"
170,170,0,Matt,6032,For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
171,171,0,Matt,6033,"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."
172,172,0,Matt,6034,"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
173,173,0,Matt,7001,"Judge not, that you be not judged."
174,174,0,Matt,7002,"For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you."
175,175,0,Matt,7003,"And why do you look at the speck in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?"
176,176,0,Matt,7004,"Or how can you say to your brother, &lsquo;Let me remove the speck from your eye&rsquo;; and look, a plank is in your own eye?"
177,177,0,Matt,7005,"Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother&rsquo;s eye."
178,178,0,Matt,7006,"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."
179,179,0,Matt,7007,"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
180,180,0,Matt,7008,"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."
181,181,0,Matt,7009,"Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?"
182,182,0,Matt,7010,"Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?"
183,183,0,Matt,7011,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
184,184,0,Matt,7012,"Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."
185,185,0,Matt,7013,"Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it."
186,186,0,Matt,7014,"Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it."
187,187,0,Matt,7015,"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves."
188,188,0,Matt,7016,You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
189,189,0,Matt,7017,"Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit."
190,190,0,Matt,7018,"A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit."
191,191,0,Matt,7019,Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
192,192,0,Matt,7020,Therefore by their fruits you will know them.
193,193,0,Matt,7021,"Not everyone who says to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven."
194,194,0,Matt,7022,"Many will say to Me in that day, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?&rsquo;"
195,195,0,Matt,7023,"And then I will declare to them, &lsquo;I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!&rsquo;"
196,196,0,Matt,7024,"Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock:"
197,197,0,Matt,7025,"and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock."
198,198,0,Matt,7026,"But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand:"
199,199,0,Matt,7027,"and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.&rdquo;"
200,200,0,Matt,7028,"And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching,"
201,201,0,Matt,7029,"for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
202,202,0,Matt,8001,"When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him."
203,203,0,Matt,8002,"And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&rdquo;"
204,204,0,Matt,8003,"Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed.&rdquo; Immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
205,205,0,Matt,8004,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&rdquo;"
206,206,0,Matt,8005,"Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him,"
207,207,0,Matt,8006,"saying, &ldquo;Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.&rdquo;"
208,208,0,Matt,8007,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I will come and heal him.&rdquo;"
209,209,0,Matt,8008,"The centurion answered and said, &ldquo;Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed."
210,210,0,Matt,8009,"For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; and he goes; and to another, &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; and he comes; and to my servant, &lsquo;Do this,&rsquo; and he does it.&rdquo;"
211,211,0,Matt,8010,"When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"
212,212,0,Matt,8011,"And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
213,213,0,Matt,8012,"But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;"
214,214,0,Matt,8013,"Then Jesus said to the centurion, &ldquo;Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.&rdquo; And his servant was healed that same hour."
215,215,0,Matt,8014,"Now when Jesus had come into Peter&rsquo;s house, He saw his wife&rsquo;s mother lying sick with a fever."
216,216,0,Matt,8015,"So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them. "
217,217,0,Matt,8016,"When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,"
218,218,0,Matt,8017,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: &ldquo;He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.&rdquo; "
219,219,0,Matt,8018,"And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side."
220,220,0,Matt,8019,"Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.&rdquo;"
221,221,0,Matt,8020,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.&rdquo;"
222,222,0,Matt,8021,"Then another of His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, let me first go and bury my father.&rdquo;"
223,223,0,Matt,8022,"But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&rdquo;"
224,224,0,Matt,8023,"Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him."
225,225,0,Matt,8024,"And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep."
226,226,0,Matt,8025,"Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, save us! We are perishing!&rdquo;"
227,227,0,Matt,8026,"But He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?&rdquo; Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
228,228,0,Matt,8027,"So the men marveled, saying, &ldquo;Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&rdquo;"
229,229,0,Matt,8028,"When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way."
230,230,0,Matt,8029,"And suddenly they cried out, saying, &ldquo;What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?&rdquo;"
231,231,0,Matt,8030,Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.
232,232,0,Matt,8031,"So the demons begged Him, saying, &ldquo;If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.&rdquo;"
233,233,0,Matt,8032,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water."
234,234,0,Matt,8033,"Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men."
235,235,0,Matt,8034,"And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region."
236,236,0,Matt,9001,"So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city."
237,237,0,Matt,9002,"Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.&rdquo;"
238,238,0,Matt,9003,"And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, &ldquo;This Man blasphemes!&rdquo;"
239,239,0,Matt,9004,"But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, &ldquo;Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
240,240,0,Matt,9005,"For which is easier, to say, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven you,&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Arise and walk&rsquo;?"
241,241,0,Matt,9006,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins&rdquo; &ndash; then He said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&rdquo;"
242,242,0,Matt,9007,And he arose and departed to his house.
243,243,0,Matt,9008,"Now when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men."
244,244,0,Matt,9009,"As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo; So he arose and followed Him."
245,245,0,Matt,9010,"Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples."
246,246,0,Matt,9011,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, &ldquo;Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;"
247,247,0,Matt,9012,"When Jesus heard that, He said to them, &ldquo;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
248,248,0,Matt,9013,"But go and learn what this means: &lsquo;I desire mercy and not sacrifice.&rsquo; For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&rdquo; "
249,249,0,Matt,9014,"Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo;"
250,250,0,Matt,9015,"And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
251,251,0,Matt,9016,"No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse."
252,252,0,Matt,9017,"Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.&rdquo;"
253,253,0,Matt,9018,"While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, &ldquo;My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.&rdquo;"
254,254,0,Matt,9019,"So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples."
255,255,0,Matt,9020,"And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment."
256,256,0,Matt,9021,"For she said to herself, &ldquo;If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.&rdquo;"
257,257,0,Matt,9022,"But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, &ldquo;Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.&rdquo; And the woman was made well from that hour."
258,258,0,Matt,9023,"When Jesus came into the ruler&rsquo;s house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing,"
259,259,0,Matt,9024,"He said to them, &ldquo;Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.&rdquo; And they ridiculed Him."
260,260,0,Matt,9025,"But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose."
261,261,0,Matt,9026,And the report of this went out into all that land.
262,262,0,Matt,9027,"When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on us!&rdquo;"
263,263,0,Matt,9028,"And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord.&rdquo;"
264,264,0,Matt,9029,"Then He touched their eyes, saying, &ldquo;According to your faith let it be to you.&rdquo;"
265,265,0,Matt,9030,"And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, &ldquo;See that no one knows it.&rdquo;"
266,266,0,Matt,9031,"But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country."
267,267,0,Matt,9032,"As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed."
268,268,0,Matt,9033,"And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, &ldquo;It was never seen like this in Israel!&rdquo;"
269,269,0,Matt,9034,"But the Pharisees said, &ldquo;He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;"
270,270,0,Matt,9035,"Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. "
271,271,0,Matt,9036,"But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd."
272,272,0,Matt,9037,"Then He said to His disciples, &ldquo;The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
273,273,0,Matt,9038,"Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.&rdquo;"
274,274,0,Matt,10001,"And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease."
275,275,0,Matt,10002,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
276,276,0,Matt,10003,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;"
277,277,0,Matt,10004,"Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him."
278,278,0,Matt,10005,"These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: &ldquo;Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans."
279,279,0,Matt,10006,But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
280,280,0,Matt,10007,"And as you go, preach, saying, &lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rsquo;"
281,281,0,Matt,10008,"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give."
282,282,0,Matt,10009,"Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,"
283,283,0,Matt,10010,"nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food."
284,284,0,Matt,10011,"Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out."
285,285,0,Matt,10012,"And when you go into a household, greet it."
286,286,0,Matt,10013,"If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you."
287,287,0,Matt,10014,"And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet."
288,288,0,Matt,10015,"Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"
289,289,0,Matt,10016,"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves."
290,290,0,Matt,10017,"But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues."
291,291,0,Matt,10018,"You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles."
292,292,0,Matt,10019,"But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;"
293,293,0,Matt,10020,"for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you."
294,294,0,Matt,10021,"Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death."
295,295,0,Matt,10022,"And you will be hated by all for My name&rsquo;s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved."
296,296,0,Matt,10023,"When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
297,297,0,Matt,10024,"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master."
298,298,0,Matt,10025,"It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!"
299,299,0,Matt,10026,"Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known."
300,300,0,Matt,10027,"Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops."
301,301,0,Matt,10028,And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
302,302,0,Matt,10029,"Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father&rsquo;s will."
303,303,0,Matt,10030,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
304,304,0,Matt,10031,"Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows."
305,305,0,Matt,10032,"Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven."
306,306,0,Matt,10033,"But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven."
307,307,0,Matt,10034,Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
308,308,0,Matt,10035,"For I have come to &lsquo;set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law&rsquo;;"
309,309,0,Matt,10036,"and &lsquo;a man&rsquo;s enemies will be those of his own household.&rsquo; "
310,310,0,Matt,10037,He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
311,311,0,Matt,10038,And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
312,312,0,Matt,10039,"He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it."
313,313,0,Matt,10040,"He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
314,314,0,Matt,10041,"He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet&rsquo;s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man&rsquo;s reward."
315,315,0,Matt,10042,"And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.&rdquo;"
316,316,0,Matt,11001,"Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities."
317,317,0,Matt,11002,"And when John had heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples"
318,318,0,Matt,11003,"and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?&rdquo;"
319,319,0,Matt,11004,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:"
320,320,0,Matt,11005,"The blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them."
321,321,0,Matt,11006,"And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.&rdquo;"
322,322,0,Matt,11007,"As they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
323,323,0,Matt,11008,"But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings&rsquo; houses."
324,324,0,Matt,11009,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet."
325,325,0,Matt,11010,"For this is he of whom it is written: &lsquo;Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.&rsquo; "
326,326,0,Matt,11011,"Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
327,327,0,Matt,11012,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."
328,328,0,Matt,11013,For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
329,329,0,Matt,11014,"And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come."
330,330,0,Matt,11015,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
331,331,0,Matt,11016,"But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,"

333,333,0,Matt,11018,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, &lsquo;He has a demon.&rsquo;"
334,334,0,Matt,11019,"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, &lsquo;Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!&rsquo; But wisdom is justified by her children.&rdquo; "
335,335,0,Matt,11020,"Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:"
336,336,0,Matt,11021,"&ldquo;Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
337,337,0,Matt,11022,"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you."
338,338,0,Matt,11023,"And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
339,339,0,Matt,11024,"But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.&rdquo;"
340,340,0,Matt,11025,"At that time Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes."
341,341,0,Matt,11026,"Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."
342,342,0,Matt,11027,"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."
343,343,0,Matt,11028,"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
344,344,0,Matt,11029,"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
345,345,0,Matt,11030,"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.&rdquo;"
346,346,0,Matt,12001,"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat."
347,347,0,Matt,12002,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, &ldquo;Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!&rdquo;"
348,348,0,Matt,12003,"But He said to them, &ldquo;Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:"
349,349,0,Matt,12004,"how he entered the house of God and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
350,350,0,Matt,12005,"Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?"
351,351,0,Matt,12006,Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple.
352,352,0,Matt,12007,"But if you had known what this means, &lsquo;I desire mercy and not sacrifice,&rsquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless."
353,353,0,Matt,12008,"For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.&rdquo;"
354,354,0,Matt,12009,"Now when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue."
355,355,0,Matt,12010,"And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&rdquo; &ndash; that they might accuse Him."
356,356,0,Matt,12011,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?"
357,357,0,Matt,12012,"Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&rdquo;"
358,358,0,Matt,12013,"Then He said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo; And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other."
359,359,0,Matt,12014,"Then the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him, how they might destroy Him."
360,360,0,Matt,12015,"But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all."
361,361,0,Matt,12016,"Yet He warned them not to make Him known,"
362,362,0,Matt,12017,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:"
363,363,0,Matt,12018,"&ldquo;Behold! My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will declare justice to the Gentiles."
364,364,0,Matt,12019,"He will not quarrel nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets."
365,365,0,Matt,12020,"A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench, till He sends forth justice to victory;"
366,366,0,Matt,12021,"and in His name Gentiles will trust.&rdquo; "
367,367,0,Matt,12022,"Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw."
368,368,0,Matt,12023,"And all the multitudes were amazed and said, &ldquo;Could this be the Son of David?&rdquo;"
369,369,0,Matt,12024,"Now when the Pharisees heard it they said, &ldquo;This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;"
370,370,0,Matt,12025,"But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: &ldquo;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
371,371,0,Matt,12026,"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?"
372,372,0,Matt,12027,"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges."
373,373,0,Matt,12028,"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you."
374,374,0,Matt,12029,"Or how can one enter a strong man&rsquo;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house."
375,375,0,Matt,12030,"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad."
376,376,0,Matt,12031,"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men."
377,377,0,Matt,12032,"Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
378,378,0,Matt,12033,"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit."
379,379,0,Matt,12034,"Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
380,380,0,Matt,12035,"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things."
381,381,0,Matt,12036,"But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment."
382,382,0,Matt,12037,"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.&rdquo;"
383,383,0,Matt,12038,"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.&rdquo;"
384,384,0,Matt,12039,"But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
385,385,0,Matt,12040,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
386,386,0,Matt,12041,"The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here."
387,387,0,Matt,12042,"The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here."
388,388,0,Matt,12043,"When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none."
389,389,0,Matt,12044,"Then he says, &lsquo;I will return to my house from which I came.&rsquo; And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order."
390,390,0,Matt,12045,"Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.&rdquo;"
391,391,0,Matt,12046,"While He was still talking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him."
392,392,0,Matt,12047,"Then one said to Him, &ldquo;Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You.&rdquo;"
393,393,0,Matt,12048,"But He answered and said to the one who told Him, &ldquo;Who is My mother and who are My brothers?&rdquo;"
394,394,0,Matt,12049,"And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, &ldquo;Here are My mother and My brothers!"
395,395,0,Matt,12050,"For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.&rdquo;"
396,396,0,Matt,13001,On the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
397,397,0,Matt,13002,"And great multitudes were gathered together to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore."
398,398,0,Matt,13003,"Then He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: &ldquo;Behold, a sower went out to sow."
399,399,0,Matt,13004,"And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them."
400,400,0,Matt,13005,"Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth."
401,401,0,Matt,13006,"But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away."
402,402,0,Matt,13007,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them."
403,403,0,Matt,13008,"But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
404,404,0,Matt,13009,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;"
405,405,0,Matt,13010,"And the disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Why do You speak to them in parables?&rdquo;"
406,406,0,Matt,13011,"He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
407,407,0,Matt,13012,"For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
408,408,0,Matt,13013,"Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand."
409,409,0,Matt,13014,"And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: &lsquo;Hearing you will hear and shall not understand, and seeing you will see and not perceive;"
410,410,0,Matt,13015,"for the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, so that I should heal them.&rsquo;"
411,411,0,Matt,13016,"But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear;"
412,412,0,Matt,13017,"for assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."
413,413,0,Matt,13018,Therefore hear the parable of the sower:
414,414,0,Matt,13019,"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside."
415,415,0,Matt,13020,"But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;"
416,416,0,Matt,13021,"yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles."
417,417,0,Matt,13022,"Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful."
418,418,0,Matt,13023,"But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.&rdquo;"
419,419,0,Matt,13024,"Another parable He put forth to them, saying: &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;"
420,420,0,Matt,13025,"but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way."
421,421,0,Matt,13026,"But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared."
422,422,0,Matt,13027,"So the servants of the owner came and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?&rsquo;"
423,423,0,Matt,13028,"He said to them, &lsquo;An enemy has done this.&rsquo; The servants said to him, &lsquo;Do you want us then to go and gather them up?&rsquo;"
424,424,0,Matt,13029,"But he said, &lsquo;No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them."
425,425,0,Matt,13030,"Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, &ldquo;First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
426,426,0,Matt,13031,"Another parable He put forth to them, saying: &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,"
427,427,0,Matt,13032,"which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.&rdquo;"
428,428,0,Matt,13033,"Another parable He spoke to them: &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.&rdquo;"
429,429,0,Matt,13034,"All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them,"
430,430,0,Matt,13035,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: &ldquo;I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.&rdquo; "
431,431,0,Matt,13036,"Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, &ldquo;Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.&rdquo;"
432,432,0,Matt,13037,"He answered and said to them: &ldquo;He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man."
433,433,0,Matt,13038,"The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one."
434,434,0,Matt,13039,"The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels."
435,435,0,Matt,13040,"Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age."
436,436,0,Matt,13041,"The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,"
437,437,0,Matt,13042,and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
438,438,0,Matt,13043,"Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
439,439,0,Matt,13044,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
440,440,0,Matt,13045,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,"
441,441,0,Matt,13046,"who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
442,442,0,Matt,13047,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,"
443,443,0,Matt,13048,"which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away."
444,444,0,Matt,13049,"So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked from among the just,"
445,445,0,Matt,13050,"and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;"
446,446,0,Matt,13051,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Have you understood all these things?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord.&rdquo; "
447,447,0,Matt,13052,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.&rdquo;"
448,448,0,Matt,13053,"Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there."
449,449,0,Matt,13054,"When He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, &ldquo;Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
450,450,0,Matt,13055,"Is this not the carpenter&rsquo;s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?"
451,451,0,Matt,13056,"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man get all these things?&rdquo;"
452,452,0,Matt,13057,"So they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.&rdquo;"
453,453,0,Matt,13058,Now He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
454,454,0,Matt,14001,At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus
455,455,0,Matt,14002,"and said to his servants, &ldquo;This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.&rdquo;"
456,456,0,Matt,14003,"For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife."
457,457,0,Matt,14004,"Because John had said to him, &ldquo;It is not lawful for you to have her.&rdquo;"
458,458,0,Matt,14005,"And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet."
459,459,0,Matt,14006,"But when Herod&rsquo;s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod."
460,460,0,Matt,14007,Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
461,461,0,Matt,14008,"So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, &ldquo;Give me John the Baptist&rsquo;s head here on a platter.&rdquo;"
462,462,0,Matt,14009,"And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded it to be given to her."
463,463,0,Matt,14010,So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
464,464,0,Matt,14011,"And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother."
465,465,0,Matt,14012,"Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus."
466,466,0,Matt,14013,"When Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities."
467,467,0,Matt,14014,"And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick."
468,468,0,Matt,14015,"When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, &ldquo;This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.&rdquo;"
469,469,0,Matt,14016,"But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.&rdquo;"
470,470,0,Matt,14017,"And they said to Him, &ldquo;We have here only five loaves and two fish.&rdquo;"
471,471,0,Matt,14018,"He said, &ldquo;Bring them here to Me.&rdquo;"
472,472,0,Matt,14019,"Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes."
473,473,0,Matt,14020,"So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained."
474,474,0,Matt,14021,"Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children."
475,475,0,Matt,14022,"Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away."
476,476,0,Matt,14023,"And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there."
477,477,0,Matt,14024,"But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary."
478,478,0,Matt,14025,"Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea."
479,479,0,Matt,14026,"And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &ldquo;It is a ghost!&rdquo; And they cried out for fear."
480,480,0,Matt,14027,"But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&rdquo;"
481,481,0,Matt,14028,"And Peter answered Him and said, &ldquo;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&rdquo;"
482,482,0,Matt,14029,"So He said, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus."
483,483,0,Matt,14030,"But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &ldquo;Lord, save me!&rdquo;"
484,484,0,Matt,14031,"And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, &ldquo;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&rdquo;"
485,485,0,Matt,14032,"And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased."
486,486,0,Matt,14033,"Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, &ldquo;Truly You are the Son of God.&rdquo;"
487,487,0,Matt,14034,"When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret."
488,488,0,Matt,14035,"And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick,"
489,489,0,Matt,14036,and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched it were made perfectly well.
490,490,0,Matt,15001,"Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,"
491,491,0,Matt,15002,"&ldquo;Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.&rdquo;"
492,492,0,Matt,15003,"He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
493,493,0,Matt,15004,"For God commanded, saying, &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.&rsquo; "
494,494,0,Matt,15005,"But you say, &lsquo;Whoever says to his father or mother, &ldquo;Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God&rdquo; &ndash;"
495,495,0,Matt,15006,"then he need not honor his father or mother.&rsquo; Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition."
496,496,0,Matt,15007,"Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:"
497,497,0,Matt,15008,"These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."
498,498,0,Matt,15009,"And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.&rdquo; "
499,499,0,Matt,15010,"When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, &ldquo;Hear and understand:"
500,500,0,Matt,15011,"Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.&rdquo;"
501,501,0,Matt,15012,"Then His disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?&rdquo;"
502,502,0,Matt,15013,"But He answered and said, &ldquo;Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted."
503,503,0,Matt,15014,"Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.&rdquo;"
504,504,0,Matt,15015,"Then Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Explain this parable to us.&rdquo;"
505,505,0,Matt,15016,"So Jesus said, &ldquo;Are you also still without understanding?"
506,506,0,Matt,15017,Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?
507,507,0,Matt,15018,"But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man."
508,508,0,Matt,15019,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies."
509,509,0,Matt,15020,"These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.&rdquo;"
510,510,0,Matt,15021,Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
511,511,0,Matt,15022,"And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.&rdquo;"
512,512,0,Matt,15023,"But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, &ldquo;Send her away, for she cries out after us.&rdquo;"
513,513,0,Matt,15024,"But He answered and said, &ldquo;I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo;"
514,514,0,Matt,15025,"Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, help me!&rdquo;"
515,515,0,Matt,15026,"But He answered and said, &ldquo;It is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the little dogs.&rdquo;"
516,516,0,Matt,15027,"And she said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table.&rdquo;"
517,517,0,Matt,15028,"Then Jesus answered and said to her, &ldquo;O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.&rdquo; And her daughter was healed from that very hour."
518,518,0,Matt,15029,"Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there."
519,519,0,Matt,15030,"Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus&rsquo; feet, and He healed them."
520,520,0,Matt,15031,"So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel."
521,521,0,Matt,15032,"Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said, &ldquo;I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.&rdquo;"
522,522,0,Matt,15033,"Then His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?&rdquo;"
523,523,0,Matt,15034,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;How many loaves do you have?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Seven, and a few little fish.&rdquo;"
524,524,0,Matt,15035,So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
525,525,0,Matt,15036,"And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude."
526,526,0,Matt,15037,"So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left."
527,527,0,Matt,15038,"Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children."
528,528,0,Matt,15039,"And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala. "
529,529,0,Matt,16001,"Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked that He would show them a sign from heaven."
530,530,0,Matt,16002,"He answered and said to them, &ldquo;When it is evening you say, &lsquo;It will be fair weather, for the sky is red&rsquo;;"
531,531,0,Matt,16003,"and in the morning, &lsquo;It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.&rsquo; Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times."
532,532,0,Matt,16004,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.&rdquo; And He left them and departed."
533,533,0,Matt,16005,"Now when His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread."
534,534,0,Matt,16006,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.&rdquo;"
535,535,0,Matt,16007,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;It is because we have taken no bread.&rdquo;"
536,536,0,Matt,16008,"But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them, &ldquo;O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread? "
537,537,0,Matt,16009,"Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?"
538,538,0,Matt,16010,Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up?
539,539,0,Matt,16011,"How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? &ndash; but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&rdquo;"
540,540,0,Matt,16012,"Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
541,541,0,Matt,16013,"When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, &ldquo;Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&rdquo;"
542,542,0,Matt,16014,"So they said, &ldquo;Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&rdquo;"
543,543,0,Matt,16015,"He said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo;"
544,544,0,Matt,16016,"Simon Peter answered and said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;"
545,545,0,Matt,16017,"Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven."
546,546,0,Matt,16018,"And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it."
547,547,0,Matt,16019,"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&rdquo;"
548,548,0,Matt,16020,Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
549,549,0,Matt,16021,"From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day."
550,550,0,Matt,16022,"Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!&rdquo;"
551,551,0,Matt,16023,"But He turned and said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.&rdquo;"
552,552,0,Matt,16024,"Then Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me."
553,553,0,Matt,16025,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it."
554,554,0,Matt,16026,"For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"
555,555,0,Matt,16027,"For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works."
556,556,0,Matt,16028,"Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.&rdquo;"
557,557,0,Matt,17001,"Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by themselves;"
558,558,0,Matt,17002,"and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light."
559,559,0,Matt,17003,"And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him."
560,560,0,Matt,17004,"Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&rdquo;"
561,561,0,Matt,17005,"While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!&rdquo;"
562,562,0,Matt,17006,"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid."
563,563,0,Matt,17007,"But Jesus came and touched them and said, &ldquo;Arise, and do not be afraid.&rdquo;"
564,564,0,Matt,17008,"When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only."
565,565,0,Matt,17009,"Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.&rdquo;"
566,566,0,Matt,17010,"And His disciples asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo;"
567,567,0,Matt,17011,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things."
568,568,0,Matt,17012,"But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands.&rdquo;"
569,569,0,Matt,17013,Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.
570,570,0,Matt,17014,"And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,"
571,571,0,Matt,17015,"&ldquo;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water."
572,572,0,Matt,17016,"So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.&rdquo;"
573,573,0,Matt,17017,"Then Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.&rdquo;"
574,574,0,Matt,17018,"And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour."
575,575,0,Matt,17019,"Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &ldquo;Why could we not cast it out?&rdquo;"
576,576,0,Matt,17020,"So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &lsquo;Move from here to there,&rsquo; and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you."
577,577,0,Matt,17021,"However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.&rdquo;"
578,578,0,Matt,17022,"Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,"
579,579,0,Matt,17023,"and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised up.&rdquo; And they were exceedingly sorrowful."
580,580,0,Matt,17024,"When they had come to Capernaum, those who received the temple tax came to Peter and said, &ldquo;Does your Teacher not pay the temple tax?&rdquo;"
581,581,0,Matt,17025,"He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, &ldquo;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?&rdquo;"
582,582,0,Matt,17026,"Peter said to Him, &ldquo;From strangers.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Then the sons are free."
583,583,0,Matt,17027,"Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.&rdquo;"
584,584,0,Matt,18001,"At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&rdquo;"
585,585,0,Matt,18002,"Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them,"
586,586,0,Matt,18003,"and said, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."
587,587,0,Matt,18004,Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
588,588,0,Matt,18005,Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.
589,589,0,Matt,18006,"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
590,590,0,Matt,18007,"Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!"
591,591,0,Matt,18008,"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire."
592,592,0,Matt,18009,"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire."
593,593,0,Matt,18010,"Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven."
594,594,0,Matt,18011,For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. 
595,595,0,Matt,18012,"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying?"
596,596,0,Matt,18013,"And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray."
597,597,0,Matt,18014,Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
598,598,0,Matt,18015,"Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother."
599,599,0,Matt,18016,"But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that &lsquo;by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.&rsquo; "
600,600,0,Matt,18017,"And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector."
601,601,0,Matt,18018,"Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
602,602,0,Matt,18019,"Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven."
603,603,0,Matt,18020,"For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.&rdquo;"
604,604,0,Matt,18021,"Then Peter came to Him and said, &ldquo;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?&rdquo;"
605,605,0,Matt,18022,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
606,606,0,Matt,18023,Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
607,607,0,Matt,18024,"And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents."
608,608,0,Matt,18025,"But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made."
609,609,0,Matt,18026,"The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, &lsquo;Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.&rsquo;"
610,610,0,Matt,18027,"Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt."
611,611,0,Matt,18028,"But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, &lsquo;Pay me what you owe!&rsquo;"
612,612,0,Matt,18029,"So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, &lsquo;Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.&rsquo; "
613,613,0,Matt,18030,"And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt."
614,614,0,Matt,18031,"So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done."
615,615,0,Matt,18032,"Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, &lsquo;You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me."
616,616,0,Matt,18033,"Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?&rsquo;"
617,617,0,Matt,18034,"And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him."
618,618,0,Matt,18035,"So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.&rdquo; "
619,619,0,Matt,19001,"Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan."
620,620,0,Matt,19002,"And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there."
621,621,0,Matt,19003,"The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, &ldquo;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?&rdquo;"
622,622,0,Matt,19004,"And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning &lsquo;made them male and female,&rsquo; "
623,623,0,Matt,19005,"and said, &lsquo;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh&rsquo;? "
624,624,0,Matt,19006,"So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."
625,625,0,Matt,19007,"They said to Him, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?&rdquo;"
626,626,0,Matt,19008,"He said to them, &ldquo;Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so."
627,627,0,Matt,19009,"And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery."
628,628,0,Matt,19010,"His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry.&rdquo;"
629,629,0,Matt,19011,"But He said to them, &ldquo;All cannot accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given:"
630,630,0,Matt,19012,"For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother&rsquo;s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven&rsquo;s sake. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it."
631,631,0,Matt,19013,"Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them."
632,632,0,Matt,19014,"But Jesus said, &ldquo;Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;"
633,633,0,Matt,19015,And He laid His hands on them and departed from there.
634,634,0,Matt,19016,"Now behold, one came and said to Him, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&rdquo;"
635,635,0,Matt,19017,"So He said to him, &ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.&rdquo;"
636,636,0,Matt,19018,"He said to Him, &ldquo;Which ones?&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;&rsquo;You shall not murder,&rsquo; &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery,&rsquo; &lsquo;You shall not steal,&rsquo; &lsquo;You shall not bear false witness,&rsquo;"
637,637,0,Matt,19019,"&rsquo;Honor your father and your mother,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
638,638,0,Matt,19020,"The young man said to Him, &ldquo;All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?&rdquo;"
639,639,0,Matt,19021,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&rdquo;"
640,640,0,Matt,19022,"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions."
641,641,0,Matt,19023,"Then Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
642,642,0,Matt,19024,"And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
643,643,0,Matt,19025,"When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo;"
644,644,0,Matt,19026,"But Jesus looked at them and said to them, &ldquo;With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&rdquo;"
645,645,0,Matt,19027,"Then Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;See, we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?&rdquo;"
646,646,0,Matt,19028,"So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
647,647,0,Matt,19029,"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name&rsquo;s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life."
648,648,0,Matt,19030,"But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
649,649,0,Matt,20001,For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
650,650,0,Matt,20002,"Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
651,651,0,Matt,20003,"And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
652,652,0,Matt,20004,"and said to them, &lsquo;You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.&rsquo; So they went."
653,653,0,Matt,20005,"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise."
654,654,0,Matt,20006,"And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, &lsquo;Why have you been standing here idle all day?&rsquo;"
655,655,0,Matt,20007,"They said to him, &lsquo;Because no one hired us.&rsquo; He said to them, &lsquo;You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.&rsquo; "
656,656,0,Matt,20008,"So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, &lsquo;Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.&rsquo;"
657,657,0,Matt,20009,"And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius."
658,658,0,Matt,20010,"But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius."
659,659,0,Matt,20011,"And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,"
660,660,0,Matt,20012,"saying, &lsquo;These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.&rsquo;"
661,661,0,Matt,20013,"But he answered one of them and said, &lsquo;Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?"
662,662,0,Matt,20014,Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.
663,663,0,Matt,20015,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?&rsquo;"
664,664,0,Matt,20016,"So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
665,665,0,Matt,20017,"Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them,"
666,666,0,Matt,20018,"&ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,"
667,667,0,Matt,20019,"and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.&rdquo;"
668,668,0,Matt,20020,"Then the mother of Zebedee&rsquo;s sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him."
669,669,0,Matt,20021,"And He said to her, &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; She said to Him, &ldquo;Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.&rdquo;"
670,670,0,Matt,20022,"But Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;We are able.&rdquo;"
671,671,0,Matt,20023,"So He said to them, &ldquo;You will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared by My Father.&rdquo;"
672,672,0,Matt,20024,"And when the ten heard it, they were greatly displeased with the two brothers."
673,673,0,Matt,20025,"But Jesus called them to Himself and said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them."
674,674,0,Matt,20026,"Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant."
675,675,0,Matt,20027,"And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave &ndash; "
676,676,0,Matt,20028,"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo;"
677,677,0,Matt,20029,"Now as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him."
678,678,0,Matt,20030,"And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!&rdquo;"
679,679,0,Matt,20031,"Then the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!&rdquo;"
680,680,0,Matt,20032,"So Jesus stood still and called them, and said, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo;"
681,681,0,Matt,20033,"They said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, that our eyes may be opened.&rdquo;"
682,682,0,Matt,20034,"So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him."
683,683,0,Matt,21001,"Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,"
684,684,0,Matt,21002,"saying to them, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me."
685,685,0,Matt,21003,"And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, &lsquo;The Lord has need of them,&rsquo; and immediately he will send them."
686,686,0,Matt,21004,"All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:"
687,687,0,Matt,21005,"Tell the daughter of Zion, &lsquo;Behold, your King is coming to you, lowly, and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
688,688,0,Matt,21006,So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
689,689,0,Matt,21007,"They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them."
690,690,0,Matt,21008,"And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road."
691,691,0,Matt,21009,"Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David! &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!&rsquo; Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo;"
692,692,0,Matt,21010,"And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;"
693,693,0,Matt,21011,"So the multitudes said, &ldquo;This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.&rdquo;"
694,694,0,Matt,21012,"Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves."
695,695,0,Matt,21013,"And He said to them, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;My house shall be called a house of prayer,&rsquo; but you have made it a &lsquo;den of thieves.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
696,696,0,Matt,21014,"Then the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them."
697,697,0,Matt,21015,"But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; they were indignant"
698,698,0,Matt,21016,"and said to Him, &ldquo;Do You hear what these are saying?&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Yes. Have you never read, &lsquo;Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise&rsquo;?&rdquo; "
699,699,0,Matt,21017,"Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and He lodged there."
700,700,0,Matt,21018,"Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry."
701,701,0,Matt,21019,"And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, &ldquo;Let no fruit grow on you ever again.&rdquo; Immediately the fig tree withered away."
702,702,0,Matt,21020,"And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, &ldquo;How did the fig tree wither away so soon?&rdquo;"
703,703,0,Matt,21021,"So Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, &lsquo;Be removed and be cast into the sea,&rsquo; it will be done."
704,704,0,Matt,21022,"And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.&rdquo;"
705,705,0,Matt,21023,"Now when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him as He was teaching, and said, &ldquo;By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?&rdquo;"
706,706,0,Matt,21024,"But Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:"
707,707,0,Matt,21025,"The baptism of John &ndash; where was it from? From heaven or from men?&rdquo; And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; He will say to us, &lsquo;Why then did you not believe him?&rsquo;"
708,708,0,Matt,21026,"But if we say, &lsquo;From men,&rsquo; we fear the multitude, for all count John as a prophet.&rdquo;"
709,709,0,Matt,21027,"So they answered Jesus and said, &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
710,710,0,Matt,21028,"But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, &lsquo;Son, go, work today in my vineyard.&rsquo;"
711,711,0,Matt,21029,"He answered and said, &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; but afterward he regretted it and went."
712,712,0,Matt,21030,"Then he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, &lsquo;I go, sir,&rsquo; but he did not go."
713,713,0,Matt,21031,"Which of the two did the will of his father?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;The first.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you."
714,714,0,Matt,21032,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterward relent and believe him."
715,715,0,Matt,21033,"Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country."
716,716,0,Matt,21034,"Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit."
717,717,0,Matt,21035,"And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another."
718,718,0,Matt,21036,"Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them."
719,719,0,Matt,21037,"Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, &lsquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo;"
720,720,0,Matt,21038,"But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, &lsquo;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.&rsquo;"
721,721,0,Matt,21039,So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
722,722,0,Matt,21040,"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?&rdquo;"
723,723,0,Matt,21041,"They said to Him, &ldquo;He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.&rdquo;"
724,724,0,Matt,21042,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures: &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. This was the LORD&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes&rsquo;? "
725,725,0,Matt,21043,"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it."
726,726,0,Matt,21044,"And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.&rdquo;"
727,727,0,Matt,21045,"Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them."
728,728,0,Matt,21046,"But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they took Him for a prophet."
729,729,0,Matt,22001,And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said:
730,730,0,Matt,22002,"&ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son,"
731,731,0,Matt,22003,"and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come."
732,732,0,Matt,22004,"Again, he sent out other servants, saying, &lsquo;Tell those who are invited, &ldquo;See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
733,733,0,Matt,22005,"But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business."
734,734,0,Matt,22006,"And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them."
735,735,0,Matt,22007,"But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city."
736,736,0,Matt,22008,"Then he said to his servants, &lsquo;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy."
737,737,0,Matt,22009,"Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.&rsquo;"
738,738,0,Matt,22010,"So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests."
739,739,0,Matt,22011,"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment."
740,740,0,Matt,22012,"So he said to him, &lsquo;Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?&rsquo; And he was speechless."
741,741,0,Matt,22013,"Then the king said to the servants, &lsquo;Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rsquo;"
742,742,0,Matt,22014,"For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;"
743,743,0,Matt,22015,Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His talk.
744,744,0,Matt,22016,"And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men."
745,745,0,Matt,22017,"Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&rdquo;"
746,746,0,Matt,22018,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, &ldquo;Why do you test Me, you hypocrites?"
747,747,0,Matt,22019,"Show Me the tax money.&rdquo; So they brought Him a denarius."
748,748,0,Matt,22020,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Whose image and inscription is this?&rdquo;"
749,749,0,Matt,22021,"They said to Him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;"
750,750,0,Matt,22022,"When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left Him and went their way."
751,751,0,Matt,22023,"The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,"
752,752,0,Matt,22024,"saying: &ldquo;Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother."
753,753,0,Matt,22025,"Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother."
754,754,0,Matt,22026,"Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh."
755,755,0,Matt,22027,Last of all the woman died also.
756,756,0,Matt,22028,"Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.&rdquo;"
757,757,0,Matt,22029,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
758,758,0,Matt,22030,"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven."
759,759,0,Matt,22031,"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,"
760,760,0,Matt,22032,"&rsquo;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rsquo;? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&rdquo;"
761,761,0,Matt,22033,"And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His teaching."
762,762,0,Matt,22034,"But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together."
763,763,0,Matt,22035,"Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,"
764,764,0,Matt,22036,"&ldquo;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?&rdquo;"
765,765,0,Matt,22037,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;&rsquo;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.&rsquo; "
766,766,0,Matt,22038,This is the first and great commandment.
767,767,0,Matt,22039,"And the second is like it: &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo; "
768,768,0,Matt,22040,"On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.&rdquo;"
769,769,0,Matt,22041,"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,"
770,770,0,Matt,22042,"saying, &ldquo;What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;The Son of David.&rdquo;"
771,771,0,Matt,22043,"He said to them, &ldquo;How then does David in the Spirit call Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; saying:"
772,772,0,Matt,22044,"&lsquo;The LORD said to my Lord, sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool&rsquo;? "
773,773,0,Matt,22045,"If David then calls Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; how is He his Son?&rdquo;"
774,774,0,Matt,22046,"And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him anymore."
775,775,0,Matt,23001,"Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples,"
776,776,0,Matt,23002,"saying: &ldquo;The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses&rsquo; seat."
777,777,0,Matt,23003,"Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do."
778,778,0,Matt,23004,"For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men&rsquo;s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers."
779,779,0,Matt,23005,But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.
780,780,0,Matt,23006,"They love the best places at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,"
781,781,0,Matt,23007,"greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, &lsquo;Rabbi, Rabbi.&rsquo;"
782,782,0,Matt,23008,"But you, do not be called &lsquo;Rabbi&rsquo;; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren."
783,783,0,Matt,23009,"Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven."
784,784,0,Matt,23010,"And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ."
785,785,0,Matt,23011,But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.
786,786,0,Matt,23012,"And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
787,787,0,Matt,23013,"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in."
788,788,0,Matt,23014,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows&rsquo; houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. "
789,789,0,Matt,23015,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves."
790,790,0,Matt,23016,"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, &lsquo;Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obliged to perform it.&rsquo;"
791,791,0,Matt,23017,"Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?"
792,792,0,Matt,23018,"And, &lsquo;Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obliged to perform it.&rsquo;"
793,793,0,Matt,23019,"Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?"
794,794,0,Matt,23020,"Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it."
795,795,0,Matt,23021,"He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it."
796,796,0,Matt,23022,"And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it."
797,797,0,Matt,23023,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone."
798,798,0,Matt,23024,"Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!"
799,799,0,Matt,23025,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. "
800,800,0,Matt,23026,"Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also."
801,801,0,Matt,23027,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men&rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness."
802,802,0,Matt,23028,"Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."
803,803,0,Matt,23029,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,"
804,804,0,Matt,23030,"and say, &lsquo;If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.&rsquo;"
805,805,0,Matt,23031,Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
806,806,0,Matt,23032,"Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers&rsquo; guilt."
807,807,0,Matt,23033,"Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?"
808,808,0,Matt,23034,"Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,"
809,809,0,Matt,23035,"that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
810,810,0,Matt,23036,"Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation."
811,811,0,Matt,23037,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
812,812,0,Matt,23038,"See! Your house is left to you desolate;"
813,813,0,Matt,23039,"for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!&rsquo;&rdquo; "
814,814,0,Matt,24001,"Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple."
815,815,0,Matt,24002,"And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.&rdquo;"
816,816,0,Matt,24003,"Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, &ldquo;Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?&rdquo;"
817,817,0,Matt,24004,"And Jesus answered and said to them: &ldquo;Take heed that no one deceives you."
818,818,0,Matt,24005,"For many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am the Christ,&rsquo; and will deceive many."
819,819,0,Matt,24006,"And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."
820,820,0,Matt,24007,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places."
821,821,0,Matt,24008,All these are the beginning of sorrows.
822,822,0,Matt,24009,"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name&rsquo;s sake."
823,823,0,Matt,24010,"And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another."
824,824,0,Matt,24011,Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.
825,825,0,Matt,24012,"And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold."
826,826,0,Matt,24013,But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
827,827,0,Matt,24014,"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come."
828,828,0,Matt,24015,"Therefore when you see the &lsquo;abomination of desolation,&rsquo; spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever reads, let him understand),"
829,829,0,Matt,24016,then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
830,830,0,Matt,24017,Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.
831,831,0,Matt,24018,And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.
832,832,0,Matt,24019,But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
833,833,0,Matt,24020,And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
834,834,0,Matt,24021,"For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be."
835,835,0,Matt,24022,"And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect&rsquo;s sake those days will be shortened."
836,836,0,Matt,24023,"Then if anyone says to you, &lsquo;Look, here is the Christ!&rsquo; or &lsquo;There!&rsquo; do not believe it."
837,837,0,Matt,24024,"For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."
838,838,0,Matt,24025,"See, I have told you beforehand."
839,839,0,Matt,24026,"Therefore if they say to you, &lsquo;Look, He is in the desert!&rsquo; do not go out; or &lsquo;Look, He is in the inner rooms!&rsquo; do not believe it."
840,840,0,Matt,24027,"For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
841,841,0,Matt,24028,"For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together."
842,842,0,Matt,24029,"Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
843,843,0,Matt,24030,"Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
844,844,0,Matt,24031,"And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."
845,845,0,Matt,24032,"Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near."
846,846,0,Matt,24033,"So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near &ndash; at the doors!"
847,847,0,Matt,24034,"Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place."
848,848,0,Matt,24035,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away."
849,849,0,Matt,24036,"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only."
850,850,0,Matt,24037,"But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
851,851,0,Matt,24038,"For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,"
852,852,0,Matt,24039,"and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
853,853,0,Matt,24040,Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.
854,854,0,Matt,24041,Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.
855,855,0,Matt,24042,"Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming."
856,856,0,Matt,24043,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into."
857,857,0,Matt,24044,"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."
858,858,0,Matt,24045,"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season?"
859,859,0,Matt,24046,"Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing."
860,860,0,Matt,24047,"Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods."
861,861,0,Matt,24048,"But if that evil servant says in his heart, &lsquo;My master is delaying his coming,&rsquo; "
862,862,0,Matt,24049,"and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,"
863,863,0,Matt,24050,"the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of,"
864,864,0,Matt,24051,and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
865,865,0,Matt,25001,Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
866,866,0,Matt,25002,"Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish."
867,867,0,Matt,25003,"Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them,"
868,868,0,Matt,25004,but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
869,869,0,Matt,25005,"But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept."
870,870,0,Matt,25006,"And at midnight a cry was heard: &lsquo;Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!&rsquo;"
871,871,0,Matt,25007,Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
872,872,0,Matt,25008,"And the foolish said to the wise, &lsquo;Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&rsquo;"
873,873,0,Matt,25009,"But the wise answered, saying, &lsquo;No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.&rsquo;"
874,874,0,Matt,25010,"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut."
875,875,0,Matt,25011,"Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, open to us!&rsquo;"
876,876,0,Matt,25012,"But he answered and said, &lsquo;Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you.&rsquo;"
877,877,0,Matt,25013,"Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming."
878,878,0,Matt,25014,"For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them."
879,879,0,Matt,25015,"And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey."
880,880,0,Matt,25016,"Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents."
881,881,0,Matt,25017,And likewise he who had received two gained two more also.
882,882,0,Matt,25018,"But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord&rsquo;s money."
883,883,0,Matt,25019,After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
884,884,0,Matt,25020,"So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, &lsquo;Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them.&rsquo;"
885,885,0,Matt,25021,"His lord said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.&rsquo;"
886,886,0,Matt,25022,"He also who had received two talents came and said, &lsquo;Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.&rsquo;"
887,887,0,Matt,25023,"His lord said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.&rsquo;"
888,888,0,Matt,25024,"Then he who had received the one talent came and said, &lsquo;Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed."
889,889,0,Matt,25025,"And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours.&rsquo;"
890,890,0,Matt,25026,"But his lord answered and said to him, &lsquo;You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed."
891,891,0,Matt,25027,"So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest."
892,892,0,Matt,25028,"Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents."
893,893,0,Matt,25029,"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away."
894,894,0,Matt,25030,"And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rsquo;"
895,895,0,Matt,25031,"When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory."
896,896,0,Matt,25032,"All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats."
897,897,0,Matt,25033,"And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left."
898,898,0,Matt,25034,"Then the King will say to those on His right hand, &lsquo;Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:"
899,899,0,Matt,25035,"for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;"
900,900,0,Matt,25036,"I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.&rsquo;"
901,901,0,Matt,25037,"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, &lsquo;Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?"
902,902,0,Matt,25038,"When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?"
903,903,0,Matt,25039,"Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?&rsquo;"
904,904,0,Matt,25040,"And the King will answer and say to them, &lsquo;Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.&rsquo;"
905,905,0,Matt,25041,"Then He will also say to those on the left hand, &lsquo;Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:"
906,906,0,Matt,25042,"for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink;"
907,907,0,Matt,25043,"I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.&rsquo;"
908,908,0,Matt,25044,"Then they also will answer Him, saying, &lsquo;Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?&rsquo;"
909,909,0,Matt,25045,"Then He will answer them, saying, &lsquo;Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.&rsquo;"
910,910,0,Matt,25046,"And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&rdquo;"
911,911,0,Matt,26001,"Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, that He said to His disciples,"
912,912,0,Matt,26002,"&ldquo;You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.&rdquo;"
913,913,0,Matt,26003,"Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,"
914,914,0,Matt,26004,and plotted to take Jesus by trickery and kill Him.
915,915,0,Matt,26005,"But they said, &ldquo;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.&rdquo;"
916,916,0,Matt,26006,"And when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,"
917,917,0,Matt,26007,"a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil, and she poured it on His head as He sat at the table."
918,918,0,Matt,26008,"But when His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, &ldquo;Why this waste?"
919,919,0,Matt,26009,"For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to the poor.&rdquo;"
920,920,0,Matt,26010,"But when Jesus was aware of it, He said to them, &ldquo;Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for Me."
921,921,0,Matt,26011,"For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always."
922,922,0,Matt,26012,"For in pouring this fragrant oil on My body, she did it for My burial."
923,923,0,Matt,26013,"Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.&rdquo;"
924,924,0,Matt,26014,"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests"
925,925,0,Matt,26015,"and said, &ldquo;What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?&rdquo; And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver."
926,926,0,Matt,26016,So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
927,927,0,Matt,26017,"Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, &ldquo;Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?&rdquo;"
928,928,0,Matt,26018,"And He said, &ldquo;Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, &lsquo;The Teacher says, &ldquo;My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
929,929,0,Matt,26019,"So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover."
930,930,0,Matt,26020,"When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve."
931,931,0,Matt,26021,"Now as they were eating, He said, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.&rdquo;"
932,932,0,Matt,26022,"And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, is it I?&rdquo;"
933,933,0,Matt,26023,"He answered and said, &ldquo;He who dipped his hand with Me in the dish will betray Me."
934,934,0,Matt,26024,"The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.&rdquo;"
935,935,0,Matt,26025,"Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, &ldquo;Rabbi, is it I?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;You have said it.&rdquo;"
936,936,0,Matt,26026,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo;"
937,937,0,Matt,26027,"Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink from it, all of you."
938,938,0,Matt,26028,"For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."
939,939,0,Matt,26029,"But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;"
940,940,0,Matt,26030,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
941,941,0,Matt,26031,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: &lsquo;I will strike the Shepherd, And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&rsquo; "
942,942,0,Matt,26032,"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.&rdquo;"
943,943,0,Matt,26033,"Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.&rdquo;"
944,944,0,Matt,26034,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo;"
945,945,0,Matt,26035,"Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!&rdquo; And so said all the disciples."
946,946,0,Matt,26036,"Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, &ldquo;Sit here while I go and pray over there.&rdquo;"
947,947,0,Matt,26037,"And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed."
948,948,0,Matt,26038,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.&rdquo;"
949,949,0,Matt,26039,"He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, &ldquo;O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.&rdquo;"
950,950,0,Matt,26040,"Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &ldquo;What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?"
951,951,0,Matt,26041,"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo;"
952,952,0,Matt,26042,"Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, &ldquo;O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.&rdquo;"
953,953,0,Matt,26043,"And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy."
954,954,0,Matt,26044,"So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
955,955,0,Matt,26045,"Then He came to His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
956,956,0,Matt,26046,"Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.&rdquo;"
957,957,0,Matt,26047,"And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people."
958,958,0,Matt,26048,"Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &ldquo;Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.&rdquo;"
959,959,0,Matt,26049,"Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, &ldquo;Greetings, Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed Him."
960,960,0,Matt,26050,"But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Friend, why have you come?&rdquo; Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him."
961,961,0,Matt,26051,"And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
962,962,0,Matt,26052,"But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
963,963,0,Matt,26053,"Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?"
964,964,0,Matt,26054,"How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?&rdquo;"
965,965,0,Matt,26055,"In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, &ldquo;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.&rdquo;"
966,966,0,Matt,26056,But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.
967,967,0,Matt,26057,"And those who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled."
968,968,0,Matt,26058,"But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priest&rsquo;s courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end."
969,4312,0,Acts,15014,Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name.
970,4313,0,Acts,15015,"And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:"
971,4314,0,Acts,15016,"&lsquo;After this I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will set it up;"
972,4315,0,Acts,15017,"so that the rest of mankind may seek the LORD, even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the LORD who does all these things.&rsquo; "
973,4316,0,Acts,15018,Known to God from eternity are all His works. 
974,4317,0,Acts,15019,"Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God,"
975,4318,0,Acts,15020,"but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood."
976,4319,0,Acts,15021,"For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.&rdquo;"
977,4320,0,Acts,15022,"Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren."
978,4321,0,Acts,15023,"They wrote this letter by them: &rdquo;The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings."
979,4322,0,Acts,15024,"Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, &lsquo;You must be circumcised and keep the law&rsquo; &ndash; to whom we gave no such commandment &ndash; "
980,4323,0,Acts,15025,"it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
981,4324,0,Acts,15026,men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
982,4325,0,Acts,15027,"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth."
983,4326,0,Acts,15028,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:"
984,4327,0,Acts,15029,"that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&rdquo;"
985,4328,0,Acts,15030,"So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter."
986,4329,0,Acts,15031,"When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement."
987,4330,0,Acts,15032,"Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words."
988,4331,0,Acts,15033,"And after they had stayed there for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles. "
989,4332,0,Acts,15034,"However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there. "
990,4333,0,Acts,15035,"Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
991,4334,0,Acts,15036,"Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &ldquo;Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.&rdquo;"
992,4335,0,Acts,15037,Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark.
993,4336,0,Acts,15038,"But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work."
994,4337,0,Acts,15039,"Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;"
995,4338,0,Acts,15040,"but Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God."
996,4339,0,Acts,15041,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
997,4340,0,Acts,16001,"Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father was Greek."
998,4341,0,Acts,16002,He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium.
999,4342,0,Acts,16003,"Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek."
1000,4343,0,Acts,16004,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem."
1001,4344,0,Acts,16005,"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily."
1002,4345,0,Acts,16006,"Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia."
1003,4346,0,Acts,16007,"After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them."
1004,4347,0,Acts,16008,"So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas."
1005,4348,0,Acts,16009,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&rdquo;"
1006,4349,0,Acts,16010,"Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them."
1007,4350,0,Acts,16011,"Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,"
1008,4351,0,Acts,16012,"and from there to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days."
1009,4352,0,Acts,16013,"And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there."
1010,4353,0,Acts,16014,"Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul."
1011,4354,0,Acts,16015,"And when she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&rdquo; So she persuaded us."
1012,4355,0,Acts,16016,"Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling."
1013,4356,0,Acts,16017,"This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, &ldquo;These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.&rdquo;"
1014,4357,0,Acts,16018,"And this she did for many days. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &ldquo;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&rdquo; And he came out that very hour."
1015,4358,0,Acts,16019,"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities."
1016,4359,0,Acts,16020,"And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, &ldquo;These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;"
1017,4360,0,Acts,16021,"and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe.&rdquo;"
1018,4361,0,Acts,16022,"Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods."
1019,4362,0,Acts,16023,"And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely."
1020,4363,0,Acts,16024,"Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks."
1021,4364,0,Acts,16025,"But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them."
1022,4365,0,Acts,16026,"Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&rsquo;s chains were loosed."
1023,4366,0,Acts,16027,"And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself."
1024,4367,0,Acts,16028,"But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.&rdquo;"
1025,4368,0,Acts,16029,"Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas."
1026,4369,0,Acts,16030,"And he brought them out and said, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo;"
1027,4370,0,Acts,16031,"So they said, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo;"
1028,4371,0,Acts,16032,Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
1029,4372,0,Acts,16033,And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were baptized.
1030,4373,0,Acts,16034,"Now when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household."
1031,4374,0,Acts,16035,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, &ldquo;Let those men go.&rdquo;"
1032,4375,0,Acts,16036,"So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, &ldquo;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.&rdquo;"
1033,4376,0,Acts,16037,"But Paul said to them, &ldquo;They have beaten us openly, uncondemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out.&rdquo;"
1034,4377,0,Acts,16038,"And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans."
1035,4378,0,Acts,16039,"Then they came and pleaded with them and brought them out, and asked them to depart from the city."
1036,4379,0,Acts,16040,"So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed."
1037,4380,0,Acts,17001,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews."
1038,4381,0,Acts,17002,"Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,"
1039,4382,0,Acts,17003,"explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, &ldquo;This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.&rdquo;"
1040,4383,0,Acts,17004,"And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas."
1041,4384,0,Acts,17005,"But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming envious, took some of the evil men from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and attacked the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
1042,4385,0,Acts,17006,"But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, &ldquo;These who have turned the world upside down have come here too."
1043,4386,0,Acts,17007,"Jason has harbored them, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king &ndash; Jesus.&rdquo;"
1044,4387,0,Acts,17008,And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.
1045,4388,0,Acts,17009,"So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go."
1046,4389,0,Acts,17010,"Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews."
1047,4390,0,Acts,17011,"These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so."
1048,4391,0,Acts,17012,"Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men."
1049,4392,0,Acts,17013,"But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds."
1050,4393,0,Acts,17014,"Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there."
1051,4394,0,Acts,17015,"So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed."
1052,4395,0,Acts,17016,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols."
1053,4396,0,Acts,17017,"Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the Gentile worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there."
1054,4397,0,Acts,17018,"Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, &ldquo;What does this babbler want to say?&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,&rdquo; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection."
1055,4398,0,Acts,17019,"And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &ldquo;May we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak?"
1056,4399,0,Acts,17020,"For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.&rdquo;"
1057,4400,0,Acts,17021,For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
1058,4401,0,Acts,17022,"Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, &ldquo;Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious;"
1059,4402,0,Acts,17023,"for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:"
1060,4403,0,Acts,17024,"God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands."
1061,4404,0,Acts,17025,"Nor is He worshiped with men&rsquo;s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things."
1062,4405,0,Acts,17026,"And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,"
1063,4764,0,Acts,28009,"So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed."
1064,4765,0,Acts,28010,"They also honored us in many ways; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary."
1065,4766,0,Acts,28011,"After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island."
1066,4767,0,Acts,28012,"And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days."
1067,4768,0,Acts,28013,"From there we circled round and reached Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli,"
1068,4769,0,Acts,28014,"where we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome."
1069,4770,0,Acts,28015,"And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage."
1070,4771,0,Acts,28016,"Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him."
1071,4772,0,Acts,28017,"And it came to pass after three days that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: &ldquo;Men and brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,"
1072,4773,0,Acts,28018,"who, when they had examined me, wanted to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death."
1073,4774,0,Acts,28019,"But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation."
1074,4775,0,Acts,28020,"For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak with you, because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.&rdquo;"
1075,4776,0,Acts,28021,"Then they said to him, &ldquo;We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you."
1076,4777,0,Acts,28022,"But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.&rdquo;"
1077,4778,0,Acts,28023,"So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening."
1078,4779,0,Acts,28024,"And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved."
1079,4780,0,Acts,28025,"So when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had said one word: &ldquo;The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,"
1080,4781,0,Acts,28026,"saying, &lsquo;Go to this people and say: Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you will see, and not perceive;"
1081,4782,0,Acts,28027,"for the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, so that I should heal them.&rsquo;"
1082,4783,0,Acts,28028,"Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!&rdquo;"
1083,4784,0,Acts,28029,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves."
1084,4785,0,Acts,28030,"Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him,"
1085,4786,0,Acts,28031,"preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him."
1086,4787,0,Rom,1001,"Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God"
1087,4788,0,Rom,1002,"which He promised before through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,"
1088,4789,0,Rom,1003,"concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,"
1089,4790,0,Rom,1004,"and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead."
1090,4791,0,Rom,1005,"Through Him we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name,"
1091,4792,0,Rom,1006,"among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;"
1092,4793,0,Rom,1007,"To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
1093,4794,0,Rom,1008,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
1094,4795,0,Rom,1009,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,"
1095,4796,0,Rom,1010,"making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you."
1096,4797,0,Rom,1011,"For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established &ndash; "
1097,4798,0,Rom,1012,"that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
1098,4799,0,Rom,1013,"Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles."
1099,4800,0,Rom,1014,"I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise."
1100,4801,0,Rom,1015,"So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also."
1101,4802,0,Rom,1016,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek."
1102,4803,0,Rom,1017,"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, &ldquo;The just shall live by faith.&rdquo; "
1103,4804,0,Rom,1018,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,"
1104,4805,0,Rom,1019,"because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them."
1105,4806,0,Rom,1020,"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,"
1106,4807,0,Rom,1021,"because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened."
1107,4808,0,Rom,1022,"Professing to be wise, they became fools,"
1108,4809,0,Rom,1023,"and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man &ndash; and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things."
1109,4810,0,Rom,1024,"Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves,"
1110,4811,0,Rom,1025,"who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
1111,4812,0,Rom,1026,For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature.
1112,4813,0,Rom,1027,"Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due."
1113,4814,0,Rom,1028,"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting;"
1114,4815,0,Rom,1029,"being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers,"
1115,4816,0,Rom,1030,"backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
1116,4817,0,Rom,1031,"undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful;"
1117,4818,0,Rom,1032,"who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them."
1118,4819,0,Rom,2001,"Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are who judge, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things."
1119,4820,0,Rom,2002,But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.
1120,4821,0,Rom,2003,"And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?"
1121,4822,0,Rom,2004,"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?"
1122,4823,0,Rom,2005,"But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,"
1123,4824,0,Rom,2006,"who &ldquo;will render to each one according to his deeds&rdquo;: "
1124,4825,0,Rom,2007,"eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality;"
1125,4826,0,Rom,2008,"but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness &ndash; indignation and wrath,"
1126,4827,0,Rom,2009,"tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;"
1127,4828,0,Rom,2010,"but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
1128,4829,0,Rom,2011,For there is no partiality with God.
1129,4830,0,Rom,2012,"For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law"
1130,4831,0,Rom,2013,"(for not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified;"
1131,4832,0,Rom,2014,"for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves,"
1132,4833,0,Rom,2015,"who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them)"
1133,4834,0,Rom,2016,"in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel."
1134,4835,0,Rom,2017,"Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest on the law, and make your boast in God,"
1135,4836,0,Rom,2018,"and know His will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,"
1136,4837,0,Rom,2019,"and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,"
1137,4838,0,Rom,2020,"an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and truth in the law."
1138,4839,0,Rom,2021,"You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?"
1139,4840,0,Rom,2022,"You who say, &ldquo;Do not commit adultery,&rdquo; do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?"
1140,4841,0,Rom,2023,"You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonor God through breaking the law?"
1141,4842,0,Rom,2024,"For &ldquo;the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,&rdquo; as it is written."
1142,4843,0,Rom,2025,"For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the law; but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
1143,4844,0,Rom,2026,"Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?"
1144,4845,0,Rom,2027,"And will not the physically uncircumcised, if he fulfills the law, judge you who, even with your written code and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law?"
1145,4846,0,Rom,2028,"For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh;"
1146,4847,0,Rom,2029,"but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God."
1147,969,0,Matt,26059,"Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,"
1148,970,0,Matt,26060,"but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward"
1149,971,0,Matt,26061,"and said, &ldquo;This fellow said, &lsquo;I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
1150,972,0,Matt,26062,"And the high priest arose and said to Him, &ldquo;Do You answer nothing? What is it these men testify against You?&rdquo;"
1151,973,0,Matt,26063,"But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, &ldquo;I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!&rdquo;"
1152,974,0,Matt,26064,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;It is as you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&rdquo;"
1153,975,0,Matt,26065,"Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, &ldquo;He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!"
1154,976,0,Matt,26066,"What do you think?&rdquo; They answered and said, &ldquo;He is deserving of death.&rdquo;"
1155,977,0,Matt,26067,"Then they spat in His face and beat Him; and others struck Him with the palms of their hands,"
1156,978,0,Matt,26068,"saying, &ldquo;Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?&rdquo;"
1157,979,0,Matt,26069,"Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, &ldquo;You also were with Jesus of Galilee.&rdquo;"
1158,980,0,Matt,26070,"But he denied it before them all, saying, &ldquo;I do not know what you are saying.&rdquo;"
1159,981,0,Matt,26071,"And when he had gone out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, &ldquo;This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;"
1160,982,0,Matt,26072,"But again he denied with an oath, &ldquo;I do not know the Man!&rdquo;"
1161,983,0,Matt,26073,"And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, &ldquo;Surely you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.&rdquo;"
1162,984,0,Matt,26074,"Then he began to curse and swear, saying, &ldquo;I do not know the Man!&rdquo; Immediately a rooster crowed."
1163,985,0,Matt,26075,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, &ldquo;Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo; So he went out and wept bitterly."
1164,986,0,Matt,27001,"When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death."
1165,987,0,Matt,27002,"And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor."
1166,988,0,Matt,27003,"Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
1167,989,0,Matt,27004,"saying, &ldquo;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;What is that to us? You see to it!&rdquo;"
1168,990,0,Matt,27005,"Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself."
1169,991,0,Matt,27006,"But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, &ldquo;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.&rdquo;"
1170,992,0,Matt,27007,"And they consulted together and bought with them the potter&rsquo;s field, to bury strangers in."
1171,993,0,Matt,27008,Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
1172,994,0,Matt,27009,"Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, &ldquo;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced,"
1173,995,0,Matt,27010,"and gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field, as the LORD directed me.&rdquo;"
1174,996,0,Matt,27011,"Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;"
1175,997,0,Matt,27012,"And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing."
1176,998,0,Matt,27013,"Then Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?&rdquo;"
1177,999,0,Matt,27014,"But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly."
1178,1000,0,Matt,27015,Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished.
1179,1001,0,Matt,27016,And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 
1180,1002,0,Matt,27017,"Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&rdquo;"
1181,1003,0,Matt,27018,For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.
1182,1004,0,Matt,27019,"While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, &ldquo;Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.&rdquo;"
1183,1005,0,Matt,27020,But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
1184,1006,0,Matt,27021,"The governor answered and said to them, &ldquo;Which of the two do you want me to release to you?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Barabbas!&rdquo;"
1185,1007,0,Matt,27022,"Pilate said to them, &ldquo;What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&rdquo; They all said to him, &ldquo;Let Him be crucified!&rdquo;"
1186,1008,0,Matt,27023,"Then the governor said, &ldquo;Why, what evil has He done?&rdquo; But they cried out all the more, saying, &ldquo;Let Him be crucified!&rdquo;"
1187,1009,0,Matt,27024,"When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, &ldquo;I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see to it.&rdquo;"
1188,1010,0,Matt,27025,"And all the people answered and said, &ldquo;His blood be on us and on our children.&rdquo;"
1189,1011,0,Matt,27026,"Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified."
1190,1012,0,Matt,27027,Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him.
1191,1013,0,Matt,27028,And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.
1192,1014,0,Matt,27029,"When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo;"
1193,1015,0,Matt,27030,"Then they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head."
1194,1016,0,Matt,27031,"And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to be crucified."
1195,1017,0,Matt,27032,"Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they compelled to bear His cross."
1196,1018,0,Matt,27033,"And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,"
1197,1019,0,Matt,27034,"they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But when He had tasted it, He would not drink."
1198,1020,0,Matt,27035,"Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: &ldquo;They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.&rdquo; "
1199,1021,0,Matt,27036,"Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there."
1200,1022,0,Matt,27037,And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
1201,1023,0,Matt,27038,"Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left."
1202,1024,0,Matt,27039,"And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads"
1203,1025,0,Matt,27040,"and saying, &ldquo;You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&rdquo;"
1204,1026,0,Matt,27041,"Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said,"
1205,1027,0,Matt,27042,"&ldquo;He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him. "
1206,1028,0,Matt,27043,"He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
1207,1029,0,Matt,27044,Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.
1208,1030,0,Matt,27045,Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.
1209,1031,0,Matt,27046,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; "
1210,1032,0,Matt,27047,"Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, &ldquo;This Man is calling for Elijah!&rdquo;"
1211,1033,0,Matt,27048,"Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink."
1212,1034,0,Matt,27049,"The rest said, &ldquo;Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.&rdquo;"
1213,1035,0,Matt,27050,"And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit."
1214,1036,0,Matt,27051,"Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,"
1215,1037,0,Matt,27052,"and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;"
1216,1038,0,Matt,27053,"and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many."
1217,1039,0,Matt,27054,"So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, &ldquo;Truly this was the Son of God!&rdquo;"
1218,1040,0,Matt,27055,"And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar,"
1219,1041,0,Matt,27056,"among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee&rsquo;s sons."
1220,1042,0,Matt,27057,"Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus."
1221,1043,0,Matt,27058,This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him.
1222,1044,0,Matt,27059,"When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
1223,1045,0,Matt,27060,"and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed."
1224,1046,0,Matt,27061,"And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb."
1225,1047,0,Matt,27062,"On the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,"
1226,1048,0,Matt,27063,"saying, &ldquo;Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, &lsquo;After three days I will rise.&rsquo;"
1227,1049,0,Matt,27064,"Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, &lsquo;He has risen from the dead.&rsquo; So the last deception will be worse than the first.&rdquo;"
1228,1050,0,Matt,27065,"Pilate said to them, &ldquo;You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.&rdquo;"
1229,1051,0,Matt,27066,"So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard."
1230,1052,0,Matt,28001,"Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb."
1231,1053,0,Matt,28002,"And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it."
1232,1054,0,Matt,28003,"His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow."
1233,1055,0,Matt,28004,"And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men."
1234,1056,0,Matt,28005,"But the angel answered and said to the women, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
1235,1057,0,Matt,28006,"He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
1236,1058,0,Matt,28007,"And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.&rdquo;"
1237,1059,0,Matt,28008,"So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word."
1238,1060,0,Matt,28009,"And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, &ldquo;Rejoice!&rdquo; So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him."
1239,1061,0,Matt,28010,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.&rdquo;"
1240,1062,0,Matt,28011,"Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened."
1241,1063,0,Matt,28012,"When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,"
1242,1064,0,Matt,28013,"saying, &ldquo;Tell them, &lsquo;His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.&rsquo;"
1243,1065,0,Matt,28014,"And if this comes to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will appease him and make you secure.&rdquo;"
1244,1066,0,Matt,28015,"So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
1245,1067,0,Matt,28016,"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them."
1246,1068,0,Matt,28017,"When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted."
1247,1069,0,Matt,28018,"And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth."
1248,1070,0,Matt,28019,"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"
1249,1071,0,Matt,28020,"teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.&rdquo;"
1250,1072,0,Mark,1001,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
1251,1073,0,Mark,1002,"As it is written in the Prophets: &ldquo;Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You."
1252,1074,0,Mark,1003,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: &lsquo;Prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
1253,1075,0,Mark,1004,John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
1254,1076,0,Mark,1005,"Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins."
1255,1077,0,Mark,1006,"Now John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey."
1256,1078,0,Mark,1007,"And he preached, saying, &ldquo;There comes One after me who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loose."
1257,1079,0,Mark,1008,"I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;"
1258,1080,0,Mark,1009,"It came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
1259,1081,0,Mark,1010,"And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove."
1260,1082,0,Mark,1011,"Then a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo;"
1261,1083,0,Mark,1012,Immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.
1262,1084,0,Mark,1013,"And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to Him."
1263,1085,0,Mark,1014,"Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
1264,1086,0,Mark,1015,"and saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.&rdquo;"
1265,1087,0,Mark,1016,"And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen."
1266,1088,0,Mark,1017,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.&rdquo;"
1267,1089,0,Mark,1018,They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
1268,1090,0,Mark,1019,"When He had gone a little farther from there, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets."
1269,1091,0,Mark,1020,"And immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him."
1270,1092,0,Mark,1021,"Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught."
1271,1093,0,Mark,1022,"And they were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
1272,1094,0,Mark,1023,"Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,"
1273,1095,0,Mark,1024,"saying, &ldquo;Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are &ndash; the Holy One of God!&rdquo;"
1274,1096,0,Mark,1025,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Be quiet, and come out of him!&rdquo;"
1275,1097,0,Mark,1026,"And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him."
1276,1098,0,Mark,1027,"Then they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.&rdquo;"
1277,1099,0,Mark,1028,And immediately His fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee.
1278,1100,0,Mark,1029,"Now as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
1279,1101,0,Mark,1030,"But Simon&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother lay sick with a fever, and they told Him about her at once."
1280,1102,0,Mark,1031,"So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them."
1281,1103,0,Mark,1032,"At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed."
1282,1104,0,Mark,1033,And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
1283,1105,0,Mark,1034,"Then He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him."
1284,1106,0,Mark,1035,"Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there He prayed."
1285,1107,0,Mark,1036,And Simon and those who were with Him searched for Him.
1286,1108,0,Mark,1037,"When they found Him, they said to Him, &ldquo;Everyone is looking for You.&rdquo;"
1287,1109,0,Mark,1038,"But He said to them, &ldquo;Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I have come forth.&rdquo;"
1288,1110,0,Mark,1039,"And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons."
1289,1111,0,Mark,1040,"Now a leper came to Him, imploring Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, &ldquo;If You are willing, You can make me clean.&rdquo;"
1290,1112,0,Mark,1041,"Then Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed.&rdquo;"
1291,1113,0,Mark,1042,"As soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed."
1292,1114,0,Mark,1043,"And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once,"
1293,1115,0,Mark,1044,"and said to him, &ldquo;See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&rdquo;"
1294,1116,0,Mark,1045,"However, he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to Him from every direction."
1295,1117,0,Mark,2001,"And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house."
1296,1118,0,Mark,2002,"Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the word to them."
1297,1119,0,Mark,2003,"Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men."
1298,1120,0,Mark,2004,"And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying."
1299,1121,0,Mark,2005,"When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Son, your sins are forgiven you.&rdquo;"
1300,1122,0,Mark,2006,"And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,"
1301,1123,0,Mark,2007,"&ldquo;Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&rdquo;"
1302,1124,0,Mark,2008,"But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, &ldquo;Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?"
1303,1125,0,Mark,2009,"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven you,&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Arise, take up your bed and walk&rsquo;?"
1304,1126,0,Mark,2010,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins&rdquo; &ndash; He said to the paralytic,"
1305,1127,0,Mark,2011,"&ldquo;I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&rdquo;"
1306,1128,0,Mark,2012,"Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, &ldquo;We never saw anything like this!&rdquo;"
1307,1129,0,Mark,2013,"Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them."
1308,1130,0,Mark,2014,"As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo; So he arose and followed Him."
1309,1131,0,Mark,2015,"Now it happened, as He was dining in Levi&rsquo;s house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him."
1310,1132,0,Mark,2016,"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, &ldquo;How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;"
1311,1133,0,Mark,2017,"When Jesus heard it, He said to them, &ldquo;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&rdquo; "
1312,1134,0,Mark,2018,"The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, &ldquo;Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo;"
1313,1135,0,Mark,2019,"And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast."
1314,1136,0,Mark,2020,"But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days."
1315,1137,0,Mark,2021,"No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse."
1316,1138,0,Mark,2022,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.&rdquo;"
1317,1139,0,Mark,2023,"Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain."
1318,1140,0,Mark,2024,"And the Pharisees said to Him, &ldquo;Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&rdquo;"
1319,1141,0,Mark,2025,"But He said to them, &ldquo;Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him:"
1320,1142,0,Mark,2026,"how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?&rdquo;"
1321,1143,0,Mark,2027,"And He said to them, &ldquo;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."
1322,1144,0,Mark,2028,"Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.&rdquo;"
1323,1145,0,Mark,3001,"And He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand."
1324,1146,0,Mark,3002,"So they watched Him closely, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him."
1325,1147,0,Mark,3003,"And He said to the man who had the withered hand, &ldquo;Step forward.&rdquo;"
1326,1148,0,Mark,3004,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?&rdquo; But they kept silent."
1327,1149,0,Mark,3005,"And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo; And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other. "
1328,1150,0,Mark,3006,"Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him."
1329,1151,0,Mark,3007,"But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea"
1330,1152,0,Mark,3008,"and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him."
1331,1153,0,Mark,3009,"So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him."
1332,1154,0,Mark,3010,"For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to touch Him."
1333,1155,0,Mark,3011,"And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, &ldquo;You are the Son of God.&rdquo;"
1334,1156,0,Mark,3012,But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.
1335,1157,0,Mark,3013,And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.
1336,1158,0,Mark,3014,"Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,"
1337,1159,0,Mark,3015,and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
1338,1160,0,Mark,3016,"Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter;"
1339,1161,0,Mark,3017,"James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, &ldquo;Sons of Thunder&rdquo;;"
1340,1162,0,Mark,3018,"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite;"
1341,1163,0,Mark,3019,"and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house."
1342,1164,0,Mark,3020,"Then the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
1343,1165,0,Mark,3021,"But when His own people heard about this, they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, &ldquo;He is out of His mind.&rdquo;"
1344,1166,0,Mark,3022,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, &ldquo;He has Beelzebub,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons.&rdquo;"
1345,1167,0,Mark,3023,"So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables: &ldquo;How can Satan cast out Satan?"
1346,1168,0,Mark,3024,"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
1347,1169,0,Mark,3025,"And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
1348,1170,0,Mark,3026,"And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end."
1349,1171,0,Mark,3027,"No one can enter a strong man&rsquo;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house."
1350,1172,0,Mark,3028,"Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter;"
1351,1173,0,Mark,3029,"but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation&rdquo; &ndash; "
1352,1174,0,Mark,3030,"because they said, &ldquo;He has an unclean spirit.&rdquo;"
1353,1175,0,Mark,3031,"Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him."
1354,1176,0,Mark,3032,"And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, &ldquo;Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You.&rdquo;"
1355,1177,0,Mark,3033,"But He answered them, saying, &ldquo;Who is My mother, or My brothers?&rdquo;"
1356,1178,0,Mark,3034,"And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, &ldquo;Here are My mother and My brothers!"
1357,1179,0,Mark,3035,"For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother.&rdquo;"
1358,1180,0,Mark,4001,"And again He began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude was gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the land facing the sea."
1359,1181,0,Mark,4002,"Then He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in His teaching:"
1360,1182,0,Mark,4003,"&ldquo;Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow."
1361,1183,0,Mark,4004,"And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it."
1362,1184,0,Mark,4005,"Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth."
1363,1185,0,Mark,4006,"But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away."
1364,1186,0,Mark,4007,"And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop."
1365,1187,0,Mark,4008,"But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.&rdquo;"
1366,1188,0,Mark,4009,"And He said to them, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;"
1367,1189,0,Mark,4010,"But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable."
1368,1190,0,Mark,4011,"And He said to them, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come in parables,"
1369,1191,0,Mark,4012,"so that &lsquo;Seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; lest they should turn, and their sins be forgiven them.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
1370,1192,0,Mark,4013,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?"
1371,1193,0,Mark,4014,The sower sows the word.
1372,1194,0,Mark,4015,"And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts."
1373,1195,0,Mark,4016,"These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"
1374,1196,0,Mark,4017,"and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word&rsquo;s sake, immediately they stumble."
1375,1197,0,Mark,4018,"Now these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word,"
1376,1198,0,Mark,4019,"and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
1377,1199,0,Mark,4020,"But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.&rdquo;"
1378,1200,0,Mark,4021,"Also He said to them, &ldquo;Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?"
1379,1201,0,Mark,4022,"For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light."
1380,1202,0,Mark,4023,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;"
1381,1203,0,Mark,4024,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Take heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given."
1382,1204,0,Mark,4025,"For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.&rdquo;"
1383,1205,0,Mark,4026,"And He said, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,"
1384,1206,0,Mark,4027,"and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how."
1385,1207,0,Mark,4028,"For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head."
1386,1208,0,Mark,4029,"But when the grain ripens, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.&rdquo;"
1387,1209,0,Mark,4030,"Then He said, &ldquo;To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it?"
1388,1210,0,Mark,4031,"It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;"
1389,1211,0,Mark,4032,"but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade.&rdquo;"
1390,1212,0,Mark,4033,And with many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it.
1391,1213,0,Mark,4034,"But without a parable He did not speak to them. And when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples."
1392,1214,0,Mark,4035,"On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, &ldquo;Let us cross over to the other side.&rdquo;"
1393,1215,0,Mark,4036,"Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him."
1394,1216,0,Mark,4037,"And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling."
1395,1217,0,Mark,4038,"But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?&rdquo;"
1396,1218,0,Mark,4039,"Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, &ldquo;Peace, be still!&rdquo; And the wind ceased and there was a great calm."
1397,1219,0,Mark,4040,"But He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?&rdquo; "
1398,1220,0,Mark,4041,"And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, &ldquo;Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!&rdquo;"
1399,1221,0,Mark,5001,"Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes. "
1400,1222,0,Mark,5002,"And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
1401,1223,0,Mark,5003,"who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains,"
1402,1224,0,Mark,5004,"because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him."
1403,1225,0,Mark,5005,"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones."
1404,1226,0,Mark,5006,"When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him."
1405,1227,0,Mark,5007,"And he cried out with a loud voice and said, &ldquo;What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God that You do not torment me.&rdquo;"
1406,1228,0,Mark,5008,"For He said to him, &ldquo;Come out of the man, unclean spirit!&rdquo;"
1407,1229,0,Mark,5009,"Then He asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; And he answered, saying, &ldquo;My name is Legion; for we are many.&rdquo;"
1408,1230,0,Mark,5010,Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.
1409,1231,0,Mark,5011,Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.
1410,1232,0,Mark,5012,"So all the demons begged Him, saying, &ldquo;Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.&rdquo;"
1411,1233,0,Mark,5013,"And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea."
1412,1234,0,Mark,5014,"So those who fed the swine fled, and they told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened."
1413,1235,0,Mark,5015,"Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid."
1414,1236,0,Mark,5016,"And those who saw it told them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the swine."
1415,1237,0,Mark,5017,Then they began to plead with Him to depart from their region.
1416,1238,0,Mark,5018,"And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him."
1417,1239,0,Mark,5019,"However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, &ldquo;Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.&rdquo;"
1418,1240,0,Mark,5020,"And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled."
1419,1241,0,Mark,5021,"Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea."
1420,1242,0,Mark,5022,"And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet"
1421,1243,0,Mark,5023,"and begged Him earnestly, saying, &ldquo;My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.&rdquo;"
1422,1244,0,Mark,5024,"So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him."
1423,1245,0,Mark,5025,"Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years,"
1424,1246,0,Mark,5026,"and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse."
1425,1247,0,Mark,5027,"When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment."
1426,1248,0,Mark,5028,"For she said, &ldquo;If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.&rdquo;"
1427,1249,0,Mark,5029,"Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction."
1428,1250,0,Mark,5030,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, &ldquo;Who touched My clothes?&rdquo;"
1429,1251,0,Mark,5031,"But His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, &lsquo;Who touched Me?&rsquo;&rdquo;"
1430,1252,0,Mark,5032,And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
1431,1253,0,Mark,5033,"But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth."
1432,1254,0,Mark,5034,"And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.&rdquo;"
1433,1255,0,Mark,5035,"While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue&rsquo;s house who said, &ldquo;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&rdquo;"
1434,1256,0,Mark,5036,"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; only believe.&rdquo;"
1435,1257,0,Mark,5037,"And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James."
1436,1258,0,Mark,5038,"Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly."
1437,1259,0,Mark,5039,"When He came in, He said to them, &ldquo;Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.&rdquo;"
1438,1260,0,Mark,5040,"And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying."
1439,1261,0,Mark,5041,"Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, &ldquo;Talitha, cumi,&rdquo; which is translated, &ldquo;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&rdquo;"
1440,1262,0,Mark,5042,"Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were overcome with great amazement."
1441,1263,0,Mark,5043,"But He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that something should be given her to eat."
1442,1264,0,Mark,6001,"Then He went out from there and came to His own country, and His disciples followed Him."
1443,1265,0,Mark,6002,"And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing Him were astonished, saying, &ldquo;Where did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, that such mighty works are performed by His hands!"
1444,1266,0,Mark,6003,"Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?&rdquo; So they were offended at Him."
1445,1267,0,Mark,6004,"But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.&rdquo;"
1446,1268,0,Mark,6005,"Now He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them."
1447,1269,0,Mark,6006,"And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching."
1448,1270,0,Mark,6007,"And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits."
1449,1271,0,Mark,6008,"He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff &ndash; no bag, no bread, no copper in their money belts &ndash; "
1450,1272,0,Mark,6009,"but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics."
1451,1273,0,Mark,6010,"Also He said to them, &ldquo;In whatever place you enter a house, stay there till you depart from that place."
1452,1274,0,Mark,6011,"And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!&rdquo;"
1453,1275,0,Mark,6012,So they went out and preached that people should repent.
1454,1276,0,Mark,6013,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them."
1455,1277,0,Mark,6014,"Now King Herod heard of Him, for His name had become well known. And he said, &ldquo;John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.&rdquo;"
1456,1278,0,Mark,6015,"Others said, &ldquo;It is Elijah.&rdquo; And others said, &ldquo;It is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets.&rdquo;"
1457,1279,0,Mark,6016,"But when Herod heard, he said, &ldquo;This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!&rdquo;"
1458,1280,0,Mark,6017,"For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife; for he had married her."
1459,1281,0,Mark,6018,"Because John had said to Herod, &ldquo;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;"
1460,1282,0,Mark,6019,"Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not;"
1461,1283,0,Mark,6020,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
1462,1284,0,Mark,6021,"Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee."
1463,1285,0,Mark,6022,"And when Herodias&rsquo; daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, &ldquo;Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.&rdquo;"
1464,1286,0,Mark,6023,"He also swore to her, &ldquo;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom.&rdquo;"
1465,1287,0,Mark,6024,"So she went out and said to her mother, &ldquo;What shall I ask?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;The head of John the Baptist!&rdquo;"
1466,1288,0,Mark,6025,"Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, &ldquo;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&rdquo;"
1467,1289,0,Mark,6026,"And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to refuse her."
1468,1290,0,Mark,6027,"Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison,"
1469,1291,0,Mark,6028,"brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."
1470,1292,0,Mark,6029,"When his disciples heard of it, they came and took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb."
1471,1293,0,Mark,6030,"Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught."
1472,1294,0,Mark,6031,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.&rdquo; For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat."
1473,1295,0,Mark,6032,So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.
1474,1296,0,Mark,6033,"But the multitudes saw them departing, and many knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to Him."
1475,1297,0,Mark,6034,"And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things."
1476,1298,0,Mark,6035,"When the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, &ldquo;This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late."
1477,1299,0,Mark,6036,"Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.&rdquo;"
1478,1300,0,Mark,6037,"But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;You give them something to eat.&rdquo; And they said to Him, &ldquo;Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?&rdquo;"
1479,1301,0,Mark,6038,"But He said to them, &ldquo;How many loaves do you have? Go and see.&rdquo; And when they found out they said, &ldquo;Five, and two fish.&rdquo;"
1480,1302,0,Mark,6039,Then He commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.
1481,1303,0,Mark,6040,"So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties."
1482,1304,0,Mark,6041,"And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among them all."
1483,1305,0,Mark,6042,So they all ate and were filled.
1484,1306,0,Mark,6043,And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish.
1485,1307,0,Mark,6044,Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.
1486,1308,0,Mark,6045,"Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away."
1487,1309,0,Mark,6046,"And when He had sent them away, He departed to the mountain to pray."
1488,1310,0,Mark,6047,"Now when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land."
1489,1311,0,Mark,6048,"Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed them by."
1490,1312,0,Mark,6049,"And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out;"
1491,1313,0,Mark,6050,"for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, &ldquo;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&rdquo;"
1492,1314,0,Mark,6051,"Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled."
1493,1315,0,Mark,6052,"For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened."
1494,1316,0,Mark,6053,"When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there."
1495,1317,0,Mark,6054,"And when they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,"
1496,1318,0,Mark,6055,"ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was."
1497,1319,0,Mark,6056,"Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well."
1498,1320,0,Mark,7001,"Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem."
1499,1321,0,Mark,7002,"Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault."
1500,1322,0,Mark,7003,"For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders."
1501,1323,0,Mark,7004,"When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received and hold, like the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches."
1502,1324,0,Mark,7005,"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, &ldquo;Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?&rdquo;"
1503,1325,0,Mark,7006,"He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: &lsquo;This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."
1504,1326,0,Mark,7007,"And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.&rsquo; "
1505,1327,0,Mark,7008,"For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men &ndash; the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other such things you do.&rdquo;"
1506,1328,0,Mark,7009,"He said to them, &ldquo;All too well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition."
1507,1329,0,Mark,7010,"For Moses said, &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.&rsquo; "
1508,1330,0,Mark,7011,"But you say, &lsquo;If a man says to his father or mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban&rdquo;&rsquo; &ndash; (that is, a gift to God),"
1509,1331,0,Mark,7012,"then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,"
1510,1332,0,Mark,7013,"making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.&rdquo;"
1511,1333,0,Mark,7014,"When He had called all the multitude to Himself, He said to them, &ldquo;Hear Me, everyone, and understand:"
1512,1334,0,Mark,7015,"There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man."
1513,1335,0,Mark,7016,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;"
1514,1336,0,Mark,7017,"When He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable."
1515,1337,0,Mark,7018,"So He said to them, &ldquo;Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,"
1516,1338,0,Mark,7019,"because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and is eliminated, thus purifying all foods?&rdquo;"
1517,1339,0,Mark,7020,"And He said, &ldquo;What comes out of a man, that defiles a man."
1518,1340,0,Mark,7021,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
1519,1341,0,Mark,7022,"thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness."
1520,1342,0,Mark,7023,"All these evil things come from within and defile a man.&rdquo;"
1521,1343,0,Mark,7024,"From there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered a house and wanted no one to know it, but He could not be hidden."
1522,1344,0,Mark,7025,"For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet."
1523,1345,0,Mark,7026,"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter."
1524,1346,0,Mark,7027,"But Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the little dogs.&rdquo;"
1525,1347,0,Mark,7028,"And she answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the children&rsquo;s crumbs.&rdquo;"
1526,1348,0,Mark,7029,"Then He said to her, &ldquo;For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.&rdquo;"
1527,1349,0,Mark,7030,"And when she had come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed."
1528,1350,0,Mark,7031,"Again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He came through the midst of the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee."
1529,1351,0,Mark,7032,"Then they brought to Him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged Him to put His hand on him."
1530,1352,0,Mark,7033,"And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue."
1531,1353,0,Mark,7034,"Then, looking up to heaven, He sighed, and said to him, &ldquo;Ephphatha,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;Be opened.&rdquo;"
1532,1354,0,Mark,7035,"Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly."
1533,1355,0,Mark,7036,"Then He commanded them that they should tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it."
1534,1356,0,Mark,7037,"And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, &ldquo;He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.&rdquo;"
1535,1357,0,Mark,8001,"In those days, the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and said to them,"
1536,1358,0,Mark,8002,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat."
1537,1359,0,Mark,8003,"And if I send them away hungry to their own houses, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar."
1538,1360,0,Mark,8004,"Then His disciples answered Him, &ldquo;How can one satisfy these people with bread here in the wilderness?&rdquo;"
1539,1361,0,Mark,8005,"He asked them, &ldquo;How many loaves do you have?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;"
1540,1362,0,Mark,8006,"So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude."
1541,1363,0,Mark,8007,"They also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, He said to set them also before them."
1542,1364,0,Mark,8008,"So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets of leftover fragments."
1543,1365,0,Mark,8009,"Now those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away,"
1544,1366,0,Mark,8010,"immediately got into the boat with His disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha."
1545,1367,0,Mark,8011,"Then the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him."
1546,1368,0,Mark,8012,"But He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, &ldquo;Why does this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.&rdquo;"
1547,1369,0,Mark,8013,"And He left them, and getting into the boat again, departed to the other side."
1548,1370,0,Mark,8014,"Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat."
1549,1371,0,Mark,8015,"Then He charged them, saying, &ldquo;Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&rdquo;"
1550,1372,0,Mark,8016,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;It is because we have no bread.&rdquo;"
1551,1373,0,Mark,8017,"But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them, &ldquo;Why do you reason because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?"
1552,1374,0,Mark,8018,"Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?"
1553,1375,0,Mark,8019,"When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Twelve.&rdquo;"
1554,1376,0,Mark,8020,"&ldquo;Also, when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;"
1555,1377,0,Mark,8021,"So He said to them, &ldquo;How is it you do not understand?&rdquo;"
1556,1378,0,Mark,8022,"Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him."
1557,1379,0,Mark,8023,"So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything."
1558,1380,0,Mark,8024,"And he looked up and said, &ldquo;I see men like trees, walking.&rdquo;"
1559,1381,0,Mark,8025,Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly.
1560,1382,0,Mark,8026,"Then He sent him away to his house, saying, &ldquo;Neither go into the town, nor tell anyone in the town.&rdquo; "
1561,1383,0,Mark,8027,"Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, &ldquo;Who do men say that I am?&rdquo;"
1562,1384,0,Mark,8028,"So they answered, &ldquo;John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.&rdquo;"
1563,1385,0,Mark,8029,"He said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo; Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;You are the Christ.&rdquo;"
1564,1386,0,Mark,8030,Then He strictly warned them that they should tell no one about Him.
1565,1387,0,Mark,8031,"And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
1566,1388,0,Mark,8032,He spoke this word openly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
1567,1389,0,Mark,8033,"But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.&rdquo;"
1568,1390,0,Mark,8034,"When He had called the people to Himself, with His disciples also, He said to them, &ldquo;Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me."
1569,1391,0,Mark,8035,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel&rsquo;s will save it."
1570,1392,0,Mark,8036,"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?"
1571,1393,0,Mark,8037,Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
1572,1394,0,Mark,8038,"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;"
1573,1395,0,Mark,9001,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God present with power.&rdquo;"
1574,1396,0,Mark,9002,"Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them."
1575,1397,0,Mark,9003,"His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them."
1576,1398,0,Mark,9004,"And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus."
1577,1399,0,Mark,9005,"Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&rdquo; &ndash;"
1578,1400,0,Mark,9006,"because he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid."
1579,1401,0,Mark,9007,"And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!&rdquo;"
1580,1402,0,Mark,9008,"Suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves."
1581,1403,0,Mark,9009,"Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead."
1582,1404,0,Mark,9010,"So they kept this word to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant."
1583,1405,0,Mark,9011,"And they asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo;"
1584,1406,0,Mark,9012,"Then He answered and told them, &ldquo;Indeed, Elijah is coming first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?"
1585,1407,0,Mark,9013,"But I say to you that Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.&rdquo;"
1586,1408,0,Mark,9014,"And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them, and scribes disputing with them."
1587,1409,0,Mark,9015,"Immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to Him, greeted Him."
1588,1410,0,Mark,9016,"And He asked the scribes, &ldquo;What are you discussing with them?&rdquo;"
1589,1411,0,Mark,9017,"Then one of the crowd answered and said, &ldquo;Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit."
1590,1412,0,Mark,9018,"And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not.&rdquo;"
1591,1413,0,Mark,9019,"He answered him and said, &ldquo;O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.&rdquo;"
1592,1414,0,Mark,9020,"Then they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth."
1593,1415,0,Mark,9021,"So He asked his father, &ldquo;How long has this been happening to him?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;From childhood."
1594,1416,0,Mark,9022,"And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&rdquo;"
1595,1417,0,Mark,9023,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo;"
1596,1418,0,Mark,9024,"Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, &ldquo;Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!&rdquo;"
1597,1419,0,Mark,9025,"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it: &ldquo;Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter him no more!&rdquo;"
1598,1420,0,Mark,9026,"Then the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him. And he became as one dead, so that many said, &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;"
1599,1421,0,Mark,9027,"But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose."
1600,1422,0,Mark,9028,"And when He had come into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, &ldquo;Why could we not cast it out?&rdquo;"
1601,1423,0,Mark,9029,"So He said to them, &ldquo;This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.&rdquo; "
1602,1424,0,Mark,9030,"Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know it."
1603,1425,0,Mark,9031,"For He taught His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, He will rise the third day.&rdquo;"
1604,1426,0,Mark,9032,"But they did not understand this saying, and were afraid to ask Him."
1605,1427,0,Mark,9033,"Then He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them, &ldquo;What was it you disputed among yourselves on the road?&rdquo;"
1606,1428,0,Mark,9034,"But they kept silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves who would be the greatest."
1607,1429,0,Mark,9035,"And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, &ldquo;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.&rdquo;"
1608,1430,0,Mark,9036,"Then He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms, He said to them,"
1609,1431,0,Mark,9037,"&ldquo;Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.&rdquo;"
1610,1432,0,Mark,9038,"Now John answered Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.&rdquo;"
1611,1433,0,Mark,9039,"But Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not forbid him, for no one who works a miracle in My name can soon afterward speak evil of Me."
1612,1434,0,Mark,9040,For he who is not against us is on our side.
1613,1435,0,Mark,9041,"For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, assuredly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward."
1614,1436,0,Mark,9042,"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea."
1615,1437,0,Mark,9043,"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having two hands, to go to hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched &ndash; "

1619,1441,0,Mark,9047,"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire &ndash; "
1620,1442,0,Mark,9048,"where &lsquo;Their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.&rsquo; "
1621,1443,0,Mark,9049,"For everyone will be seasoned with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt."
1622,1444,0,Mark,9050,"Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace with one another.&rdquo;"
1623,1445,0,Mark,10001,"Then He arose from there and came to the region of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And multitudes gathered to Him again, and as He was accustomed, He taught them again."
1624,1446,0,Mark,10002,"The Pharisees came and asked Him, &ldquo;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?&rdquo; testing Him."
1625,1447,0,Mark,10003,"And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;What did Moses command you?&rdquo;"
1626,1448,0,Mark,10004,"They said, &ldquo;Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to dismiss her.&rdquo;"
1627,1449,0,Mark,10005,"And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."
1628,1450,0,Mark,10006,"But from the beginning of the creation, God &lsquo;made them male and female.&rsquo; "
1629,1451,0,Mark,10007,"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,"
1630,1452,0,Mark,10008,"&lsquo;and the two shall become one flesh&rsquo;; so then they are no longer two, but one flesh."
1631,1453,0,Mark,10009,"Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.&rdquo;"
1632,1454,0,Mark,10010,In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same matter.
1633,1455,0,Mark,10011,"So He said to them, &ldquo;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her."
1634,1456,0,Mark,10012,"And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.&rdquo;"
1635,1457,0,Mark,10013,"Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them."
1636,1458,0,Mark,10014,"But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, &ldquo;Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God."
1637,1459,0,Mark,10015,"Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.&rdquo;"
1638,1460,0,Mark,10016,"And He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them."
1639,1461,0,Mark,10017,"Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&rdquo;"
1640,1462,0,Mark,10018,"So Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God."
1641,1463,0,Mark,10019,"You know the commandments: &lsquo;Do not commit adultery,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not murder,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not steal,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not bear false witness,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not defraud,&rsquo; &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
1642,1464,0,Mark,10020,"And he answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.&rdquo;"
1643,1465,0,Mark,10021,"Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, &ldquo;One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.&rdquo;"
1644,1466,0,Mark,10022,"But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions."
1645,1467,0,Mark,10023,"Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, &ldquo;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!&rdquo;"
1646,1468,0,Mark,10024,"And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, &ldquo;Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!"
1647,1469,0,Mark,10025,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
1648,1470,0,Mark,10026,"And they were greatly astonished, saying among themselves, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo;"
1649,1471,0,Mark,10027,"But Jesus looked at them and said, &ldquo;With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.&rdquo;"
1650,1472,0,Mark,10028,"Then Peter began to say to Him, &ldquo;See, we have left all and followed You.&rdquo;"
1651,1473,0,Mark,10029,"So Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My sake and the gospel&rsquo;s,"
1652,1474,0,Mark,10030,"who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time &ndash; houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions &ndash; and in the age to come, eternal life."
1653,1475,0,Mark,10031,"But many who are first will be last, and the last first.&rdquo;"
1654,1476,0,Mark,10032,"Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed. And as they followed they were afraid. Then He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them the things that would happen to Him:"
1655,1477,0,Mark,10033,"&ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the Gentiles;"

1657,1479,0,Mark,10035,"Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.&rdquo;"
1658,1480,0,Mark,10036,"And He said to them, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo;"
1659,1481,0,Mark,10037,"They said to Him, &ldquo;Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.&rdquo;"
1660,1482,0,Mark,10038,"But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&rdquo;"
1661,1483,0,Mark,10039,"They said to Him, &ldquo;We are able.&rdquo; So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized;"
1662,1484,0,Mark,10040,"but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared.&rdquo;"
1663,1485,0,Mark,10041,"And when the ten heard it, they began to be greatly displeased with James and John."
1664,1486,0,Mark,10042,"But Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, &ldquo;You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them."
1665,1487,0,Mark,10043,"Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant."
1666,1488,0,Mark,10044,And whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all.
1667,1489,0,Mark,10045,"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo;"
1668,1490,0,Mark,10046,"Now they came to Jericho. As He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the road begging."
1669,1491,0,Mark,10047,"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, &ldquo;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;"
1670,1492,0,Mark,10048,"Then many warned him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;"
1671,1493,0,Mark,10049,"So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. Then they called the blind man, saying to him, &ldquo;Be of good cheer. Rise, He is calling you.&rdquo;"
1672,1494,0,Mark,10050,"And throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus."
1673,1495,0,Mark,10051,"So Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; The blind man said to Him, &ldquo;Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.&rdquo;"
1674,1496,0,Mark,10052,"Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go your way; your faith has made you well.&rdquo; And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road."
1675,1497,0,Mark,11001,"Now when they drew near Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples;"
1676,1498,0,Mark,11002,"and He said to them, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you; and as soon as you have entered it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has sat. Loose it and bring it."
1677,1499,0,Mark,11003,"And if anyone says to you, &lsquo;Why are you doing this?&rsquo; say, &lsquo;The Lord has need of it,&rsquo; and immediately he will send it here.&rdquo;"
1678,1500,0,Mark,11004,"So they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it."
1679,1501,0,Mark,11005,"But some of those who stood there said to them, &ldquo;What are you doing, loosing the colt?&rdquo;"
1680,1502,0,Mark,11006,And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go.
1681,1503,0,Mark,11007,"Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it."
1682,1504,0,Mark,11008,"And many spread their clothes on the road, and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread them on the road."
1683,1505,0,Mark,11009,"Then those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: &ldquo;Hosanna! &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!&rsquo; "
1684,1506,0,Mark,11010,"Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo;"
1685,1507,0,Mark,11011,"And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve."
1686,1508,0,Mark,11012,"Now the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry."
1687,1509,0,Mark,11013,"And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."
1688,1510,0,Mark,11014,"In response Jesus said to it, &ldquo;Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.&rdquo; And His disciples heard it."
1689,1511,0,Mark,11015,"So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves."
1690,1512,0,Mark,11016,And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple.
1691,1513,0,Mark,11017,"Then He taught, saying to them, &ldquo;Is it not written, &lsquo;My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations&rsquo;? But you have made it a &lsquo;den of thieves.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
1692,1514,0,Mark,11018,"And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching."
1693,1515,0,Mark,11019,"When evening had come, He went out of the city."
1694,1516,0,Mark,11020,"Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots."
1695,1517,0,Mark,11021,"And Peter, remembering, said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.&rdquo;"
1696,1518,0,Mark,11022,"So Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Have faith in God."
1697,1519,0,Mark,11023,"For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, &lsquo;Be removed and be cast into the sea,&rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says."
1698,1520,0,Mark,11024,"Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them."
1699,1521,0,Mark,11025,"And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses."
1700,1522,0,Mark,11026,"But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.&rdquo;"
1701,1523,0,Mark,11027,"Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him."
1702,1524,0,Mark,11028,"And they said to Him, &ldquo;By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?&rdquo;"
1703,1525,0,Mark,11029,"But Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;I also will ask you one question; then answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:"
1704,1526,0,Mark,11030,"The baptism of John &ndash; was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me.&rdquo;"
1705,1527,0,Mark,11031,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Why then did you not believe him?&rsquo;"
1706,1528,0,Mark,11032,"But if we say, &lsquo;From men&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash; they feared the people, for all counted John to have been a prophet indeed."
1707,1529,0,Mark,11033,"So they answered and said to Jesus, &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&rdquo;"
1708,1530,0,Mark,12001,"Then He began to speak to them in parables: &ldquo;A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country."
1709,1531,0,Mark,12002,"Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers."
1710,1532,0,Mark,12003,And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
1711,1533,0,Mark,12004,"Again he sent them another servant, and at him they threw stones, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated."
1712,1534,0,Mark,12005,"And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some."
1713,1535,0,Mark,12006,"Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, &lsquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo;"
1714,1536,0,Mark,12007,"But those vinedressers said among themselves, &lsquo;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.&rsquo;"
1715,1537,0,Mark,12008,So they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.
1716,1538,0,Mark,12009,"Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others."
1717,1539,0,Mark,12010,"Have you not even read this Scripture: &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone."
1718,1540,0,Mark,12011,"This was the LORD&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes&rsquo;?&rdquo; "
1719,1541,0,Mark,12012,"And they sought to lay hands on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away."
1720,1542,0,Mark,12013,"Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in His words."
1721,1543,0,Mark,12014,"When they had come, they said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You are true, and care about no one; for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
1722,1544,0,Mark,12015,"Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?&rdquo; But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, &ldquo;Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see it.&rdquo;"
1723,1545,0,Mark,12016,"So they brought it. And He said to them, &ldquo;Whose image and inscription is this?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;"
1724,1546,0,Mark,12017,"And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And they marveled at Him."
1725,1547,0,Mark,12018,"Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying:"
1726,1548,0,Mark,12019,"&ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man&rsquo;s brother dies, and leaves his wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother."
1727,1549,0,Mark,12020,"Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no offspring."
1728,1550,0,Mark,12021,"And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise."
1729,1551,0,Mark,12022,So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also.
1730,1552,0,Mark,12023,"Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.&rdquo;"
1731,1553,0,Mark,12024,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Are you not therefore mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?"
1732,1554,0,Mark,12025,"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
1733,1555,0,Mark,12026,"But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the burning bush passage, how God spoke to him, saying, &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rsquo;? "
1734,1556,0,Mark,12027,"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken.&rdquo;"
1735,1557,0,Mark,12028,"Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, &ldquo;Which is the first commandment of all?&rdquo;"
1736,1558,0,Mark,12029,"Jesus answered him, &ldquo;The first of all the commandments is: &lsquo;Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one."
1737,1559,0,Mark,12030,"And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&rsquo; This is the first commandment. "
1738,1560,0,Mark,12031,"And the second, like it, is this: &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo; There is no other commandment greater than these.&rdquo;"
1739,1561,0,Mark,12032,"So the scribe said to Him, &ldquo;Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He."
1740,1562,0,Mark,12033,"And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one&rsquo;s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&rdquo;"
1741,1563,0,Mark,12034,"Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, &ldquo;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&rdquo; But after that no one dared question Him."
1742,1564,0,Mark,12035,"Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, &ldquo;How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?"
1743,1565,0,Mark,12036,"For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: &lsquo;The LORD said to my Lord, sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&rsquo; "
1744,1566,0,Mark,12037,"Therefore David himself calls Him &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;; how is He then his Son?&rdquo; And the common people heard Him gladly."
1745,1567,0,Mark,12038,"Then He said to them in His teaching, &ldquo;Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces,"
1746,1568,0,Mark,12039,"the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts,"
1747,1569,0,Mark,12040,"who devour widows&rsquo; houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.&rdquo;"
1748,1570,0,Mark,12041,Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money into the treasury. And many who were rich put in much.
1749,1571,0,Mark,12042,"Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans."
1750,1572,0,Mark,12043,"So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury;"
1751,1573,0,Mark,12044,"for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood.&rdquo;"
1752,1574,0,Mark,13001,"Then as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!&rdquo;"
1753,1575,0,Mark,13002,"And Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon another, that shall not be thrown down.&rdquo;"
1754,1576,0,Mark,13003,"Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,"
1755,1577,0,Mark,13004,"&ldquo;Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things will be fulfilled?&rdquo;"
1756,1578,0,Mark,13005,"And Jesus, answering them, began to say: &ldquo;Take heed that no one deceives you."
1757,1579,0,Mark,13006,"For many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am He,&rsquo; and will deceive many."
1758,1580,0,Mark,13007,"But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled; for such things must happen, but the end is not yet."
1759,1581,0,Mark,13008,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows."
1760,1582,0,Mark,13009,"But watch out for yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them."
1761,1583,0,Mark,13010,And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
1762,1584,0,Mark,13011,"But when they arrest you and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand, or premeditate what you will speak. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak that; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit."
1763,1585,0,Mark,13012,"Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death."
1764,1586,0,Mark,13013,"And you will be hated by all for My name&rsquo;s sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved."
1765,1587,0,Mark,13014,"So when you see the &lsquo;abomination of desolation,&rsquo; spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), &ldquo;then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."
1766,1588,0,Mark,13015,"Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house."
1767,1589,0,Mark,13016,And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.
1768,1590,0,Mark,13017,But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
1769,1591,0,Mark,13018,And pray that your flight may not be in winter.
1770,1592,0,Mark,13019,"For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time, nor ever shall be."
1771,1593,0,Mark,13020,"And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect&rsquo;s sake, whom He chose, He shortened the days."
1772,1594,0,Mark,13021,"Then if anyone says to you, &lsquo;Look, here is the Christ!&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Look, He is there!&rsquo; do not believe it."
1773,1595,0,Mark,13022,"For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."
1774,1596,0,Mark,13023,"But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand."
1775,1597,0,Mark,13024,"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;"
1776,1598,0,Mark,13025,"the stars of heaven will fall, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken."
1777,1599,0,Mark,13026,Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
1778,1600,0,Mark,13027,"And then He will send His angels, and gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven."
1779,1601,0,Mark,13028,"Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near."
1780,1602,0,Mark,13029,"So you also, when you see these things happening, know that it is near &ndash; at the doors!"
1781,1603,0,Mark,13030,"Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place."
1782,1604,0,Mark,13031,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away."
1783,1605,0,Mark,13032,"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
1784,1606,0,Mark,13033,"Take heed, watch and pray; for you do not know when the time is."
1785,1607,0,Mark,13034,"It is like a man going to a far country, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch."
1786,1608,0,Mark,13035,"Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming &ndash; in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning &ndash; "
1787,1609,0,Mark,13036,"lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping."
1788,1610,0,Mark,13037,"And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!&rdquo;"
1789,1611,0,Mark,14001,After two days it was the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by trickery and put Him to death.
1790,1612,0,Mark,14002,"But they said, &ldquo;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.&rdquo;"
1791,1613,0,Mark,14003,"And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head."
1792,1614,0,Mark,14004,"But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, &ldquo;Why was this fragrant oil wasted?"
1793,1615,0,Mark,14005,"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.&rdquo; And they criticized her sharply."
1794,1616,0,Mark,14006,"But Jesus said, &ldquo;Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me."
1795,1617,0,Mark,14007,"For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish you may do them good; but Me you do not have always."
1796,1618,0,Mark,14008,She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial.
1797,1619,0,Mark,14009,"Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.&rdquo;"
1798,1620,0,Mark,14010,"Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Him to them."
1799,1621,0,Mark,14011,"And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought how he might conveniently betray Him."
1800,1622,0,Mark,14012,"Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Where do You want us to go and prepare, that You may eat the Passover?&rdquo;"
1801,1623,0,Mark,14013,"And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him."
1802,1624,0,Mark,14014,"Wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, &lsquo;The Teacher says: Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?&rsquo;&rdquo; "
1803,1625,0,Mark,14015,"Then he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared; there make ready for us.&rdquo;"
1804,1626,0,Mark,14016,"So His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it just as He had said to them; and they prepared the Passover."
1805,1627,0,Mark,14017,In the evening He came with the twelve.
1806,1628,0,Mark,14018,"Now as they sat and ate, Jesus said, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, one of you who eats with Me will betray Me.&rdquo;"
1807,1629,0,Mark,14019,"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to Him one by one, &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo; And another said, &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo; "
1808,1630,0,Mark,14020,"He answered and said to them, &ldquo;It is one of the twelve, who dips with Me in the dish."
1809,1631,0,Mark,14021,"The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.&rdquo;"
1810,1632,0,Mark,14022,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo;"
1811,1633,0,Mark,14023,"Then He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and they all drank from it."
1812,1634,0,Mark,14024,"And He said to them, &ldquo;This is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many."
1813,1635,0,Mark,14025,"Assuredly, I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
1814,1636,0,Mark,14026,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
1815,1637,0,Mark,14027,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: &lsquo;I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&rsquo; "
1816,1638,0,Mark,14028,"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.&rdquo;"
1817,1639,0,Mark,14029,"Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Even if all are made to stumble, yet I will not be.&rdquo;"
1818,1640,0,Mark,14030,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you that today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo;"
1819,1641,0,Mark,14031,"But he spoke more vehemently, &ldquo;If I have to die with You, I will not deny You!&rdquo; And they all said likewise."
1820,1642,0,Mark,14032,"Then they came to a place which was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Sit here while I pray.&rdquo;"
1821,1643,0,Mark,14033,"And He took Peter, James, and John with Him, and He began to be troubled and deeply distressed."
1822,1644,0,Mark,14034,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch.&rdquo;"
1823,1645,0,Mark,14035,"He went a little farther, and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him."
1824,1646,0,Mark,14036,"And He said, &ldquo;Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.&rdquo;"
1825,1647,0,Mark,14037,"Then He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &ldquo;Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour?"
1826,1648,0,Mark,14038,"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo;"
1827,1649,0,Mark,14039,"Again He went away and prayed, and spoke the same words."
1828,1650,0,Mark,14040,"And when He returned, He found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him."
1829,1651,0,Mark,14041,"Then He came the third time and said to them, &ldquo;Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
1830,1652,0,Mark,14042,"Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.&rdquo;"
1831,1653,0,Mark,14043,"And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
1832,1654,0,Mark,14044,"Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, &ldquo;Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him and lead Him away safely.&rdquo;"
1833,1655,0,Mark,14045,"As soon as he had come, immediately he went up to Him and said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed Him."
1834,1656,0,Mark,14046,Then they laid their hands on Him and took Him.
1835,1657,0,Mark,14047,"And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
1836,1658,0,Mark,14048,"Then Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me?"
1837,1659,0,Mark,14049,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.&rdquo;"
1838,1660,0,Mark,14050,Then they all forsook Him and fled.
1839,1661,0,Mark,14051,"Now a certain young man followed Him, having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body. And the young men laid hold of him,"
1840,1662,0,Mark,14052,and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.
1841,1663,0,Mark,14053,"And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes."
1842,1664,0,Mark,14054,"But Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire."
1843,1665,0,Mark,14055,"Now the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none."
1844,1666,0,Mark,14056,"For many bore false witness against Him, but their testimonies did not agree."
1845,1667,0,Mark,14057,"Then some rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying,"
1846,1668,0,Mark,14058,"&ldquo;We heard Him say, &lsquo;I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
1847,1669,0,Mark,14059,But not even then did their testimony agree.
1848,1670,0,Mark,14060,"And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Do You answer nothing? What is it these men testify against You?&rdquo;"
1849,1671,0,Mark,14061,"But He kept silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, &ldquo;Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&rdquo;"
1850,1672,0,Mark,14062,"Jesus said, &ldquo;I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.&rdquo;"
1851,1673,0,Mark,14063,"Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, &ldquo;What further need do we have of witnesses?"
1852,1674,0,Mark,14064,"You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?&rdquo; And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death."
1853,1675,0,Mark,14065,"Then some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him, and to say to Him, &ldquo;Prophesy!&rdquo; And the officers struck Him with the palms of their hands. "
1854,1676,0,Mark,14066,"Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came."
1855,1677,0,Mark,14067,"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, &ldquo;You also were with Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;"
1856,1678,0,Mark,14068,"But he denied it, saying, &ldquo;I neither know nor understand what you are saying.&rdquo; And he went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed."
1857,1679,0,Mark,14069,"And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, &ldquo;This is one of them.&rdquo;"
1858,1680,0,Mark,14070,"But he denied it again. And a little later those who stood by said to Peter again, &ldquo;Surely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.&rdquo; "
1859,1681,0,Mark,14071,"Then he began to curse and swear, &ldquo;I do not know this Man of whom you speak!&rdquo;"
1860,1682,0,Mark,14072,"A second time the rooster crowed. Then Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, &ldquo;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo; And when he thought about it, he wept."
1861,1683,0,Mark,15001,"Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate."
1862,1684,0,Mark,15002,"Then Pilate asked Him, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; He answered and said to him, &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;"
1863,1685,0,Mark,15003,"And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing."
1864,1686,0,Mark,15004,"Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, &ldquo;Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!&rdquo; "
1865,1687,0,Mark,15005,"But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled."
1866,1688,0,Mark,15006,"Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested."
1867,1689,0,Mark,15007,"And there was one named Barabbas, who was chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion."
1868,1690,0,Mark,15008,"Then the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them."
1869,1691,0,Mark,15009,"But Pilate answered them, saying, &ldquo;Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;"
1870,1692,0,Mark,15010,For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.
1871,1693,0,Mark,15011,"But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them."
1872,1694,0,Mark,15012,"Pilate answered and said to them again, &ldquo;What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?&rdquo;"
1873,1695,0,Mark,15013,"So they cried out again, &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo;"
1874,1696,0,Mark,15014,"Then Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Why, what evil has He done?&rdquo; But they cried out all the more, &ldquo;Crucify Him!&rdquo;"
1875,1697,0,Mark,15015,"So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged Him, to be crucified."
1876,1698,0,Mark,15016,"Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison."
1877,1699,0,Mark,15017,"And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His head,"
1878,1700,0,Mark,15018,"and began to salute Him, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo;"
1879,1701,0,Mark,15019,"Then they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him."
1880,1702,0,Mark,15020,"And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him."
1881,1703,0,Mark,15021,"Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross."
1882,1704,0,Mark,15022,"And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull."
1883,1705,0,Mark,15023,"Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it."
1884,1706,0,Mark,15024,"And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them to determine what every man should take."
1885,1707,0,Mark,15025,"Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him."
1886,1708,0,Mark,15026,And the inscription of His accusation was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
1887,1709,0,Mark,15027,"With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left."
1888,1710,0,Mark,15028,"So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;And He was numbered with the transgressors.&rdquo; "
1889,1711,0,Mark,15029,"And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, &ldquo;Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,"
1890,1712,0,Mark,15030,"save Yourself, and come down from the cross!&rdquo;"
1891,1713,0,Mark,15031,"Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, &ldquo;He saved others; Himself He cannot save."
1892,1714,0,Mark,15032,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.&rdquo; Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him."
1893,1715,0,Mark,15033,"Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
1894,1716,0,Mark,15034,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&rdquo; which is translated, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; "
1895,1717,0,Mark,15035,"Some of those who stood by, when they heard that, said, &ldquo;Look, He is calling for Elijah!&rdquo;"
1896,1718,0,Mark,15036,"Then someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, &ldquo;Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down.&rdquo;"
1897,1719,0,Mark,15037,"And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last."
1898,1720,0,Mark,15038,Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
1899,1721,0,Mark,15039,"So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, &ldquo;Truly this Man was the Son of God!&rdquo;"
1900,1722,0,Mark,15040,"There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome,"
1901,1723,0,Mark,15041,"who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem."
1902,1724,0,Mark,15042,"Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,"
1903,1725,0,Mark,15043,"Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
1904,1726,0,Mark,15044,"Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time."
1905,1727,0,Mark,15045,"So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph."
1906,1728,0,Mark,15046,"Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb."
1907,1729,0,Mark,15047,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.
1908,1730,0,Mark,16001,"Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him."
1909,1731,0,Mark,16002,"Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen."
1910,1732,0,Mark,16003,"And they said among themselves, &ldquo;Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?&rdquo;"
1911,1733,0,Mark,16004,"But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away &ndash; for it was very large."
1912,1734,0,Mark,16005,"And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed."
1913,1735,0,Mark,16006,"But he said to them, &ldquo;Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him."
1914,1736,0,Mark,16007,"But go, tell His disciples &ndash; and Peter &ndash; that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.&rdquo;"
1915,1737,0,Mark,16008,"So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid."
1916,1738,0,Mark,16009,"Now when He rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons."
1917,1739,0,Mark,16010,"She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept."
1918,1740,0,Mark,16011,"And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe."
1919,1741,0,Mark,16012,"After that, He appeared in another form to two of them as they walked and went into the country."
1920,1742,0,Mark,16013,"And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them either."
1921,1743,0,Mark,16014,"Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen."
1922,1744,0,Mark,16015,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature."
1923,1745,0,Mark,16016,"He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned."
1924,1746,0,Mark,16017,"And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;"
1925,1747,0,Mark,16018,"they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.&rdquo;"
1926,1748,0,Mark,16019,"So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."
1927,1749,0,Mark,16020,"And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen."
1928,1750,0,Luke,1001,"Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled among us,"
1929,1751,0,Luke,1002,"just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,"
1930,1752,0,Luke,1003,"it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,"
1931,1753,0,Luke,1004,that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.
1932,1754,0,Luke,1005,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth."
1933,1755,0,Luke,1006,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
1934,1756,0,Luke,1007,"But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years."
1935,1757,0,Luke,1008,"So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,"
1936,1758,0,Luke,1009,"according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord."
1937,1759,0,Luke,1010,And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.
1938,1760,0,Luke,1011,"Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense."
1939,1761,0,Luke,1012,"And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him."
1940,1762,0,Luke,1013,"But the angel said to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John."
1941,1763,0,Luke,1014,"And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth."
1942,1764,0,Luke,1015,"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb."
1943,1765,0,Luke,1016,And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.
1944,1766,0,Luke,1017,"He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, &lsquo;to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,&rsquo; and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
1945,1767,0,Luke,1018,"And Zacharias said to the angel, &ldquo;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.&rdquo;"
1946,1768,0,Luke,1019,"And the angel answered and said to him, &ldquo;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings."
1947,1769,0,Luke,1020,"But behold, you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their own time.&rdquo;"
1948,1770,0,Luke,1021,"And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple."
1949,1771,0,Luke,1022,"But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he beckoned to them and remained speechless."
1950,1772,0,Luke,1023,"So it was, as soon as the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house."
1951,1773,0,Luke,1024,"Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,"
1952,1774,0,Luke,1025,"&ldquo;Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&rdquo;"
1953,1775,0,Luke,1026,"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,"
1954,1776,0,Luke,1027,"to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary."
1955,1777,0,Luke,1028,"And having come in, the angel said to her, &ldquo;Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!&rdquo; "
1956,1778,0,Luke,1029,"But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was."
1957,1779,0,Luke,1030,"Then the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God."
1958,1780,0,Luke,1031,"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS."
1959,1781,0,Luke,1032,"He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David."
1960,1782,0,Luke,1033,"And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.&rdquo;"
1961,1783,0,Luke,1034,"Then Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How can this be, since I do not know a man?&rdquo;"
1962,1784,0,Luke,1035,"And the angel answered and said to her, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God."
1963,1785,0,Luke,1036,"Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren."
1964,1786,0,Luke,1037,"For with God nothing will be impossible.&rdquo;"
1965,1787,0,Luke,1038,"Then Mary said, &ldquo;Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.&rdquo; And the angel departed from her."
1966,1788,0,Luke,1039,"Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,"
1967,1789,0,Luke,1040,and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
1968,1790,0,Luke,1041,"And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."
1969,1791,0,Luke,1042,"Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
1970,1792,0,Luke,1043,"But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
1971,1793,0,Luke,1044,"For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
1972,1794,0,Luke,1045,"Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.&rdquo;"
1973,1795,0,Luke,1046,"And Mary said: &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord,"
1974,1796,0,Luke,1047,and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
1975,1797,0,Luke,1048,"For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant; for behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed."
1976,1798,0,Luke,1049,"For He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name."
1977,1799,0,Luke,1050,And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.
1978,1800,0,Luke,1051,"He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
1979,1801,0,Luke,1052,"He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly."
1980,1802,0,Luke,1053,"He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty."
1981,1803,0,Luke,1054,"He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,"
1982,1804,0,Luke,1055,"as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.&rdquo;"
1983,1805,0,Luke,1056,"And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house."
1984,1806,0,Luke,1057,"Now Elizabeth&rsquo;s full time came for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son."
1985,1807,0,Luke,1058,"When her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her."
1986,1808,0,Luke,1059,"So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him by the name of his father, Zacharias."
1987,1809,0,Luke,1060,"His mother answered and said, &ldquo;No; he shall be called John.&rdquo;"
1988,1810,0,Luke,1061,"But they said to her, &ldquo;There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.&rdquo;"
1989,1811,0,Luke,1062,"So they made signs to his father &ndash; what he would have him called."
1990,1812,0,Luke,1063,"And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, &ldquo;His name is John.&rdquo; So they all marveled."
1991,1813,0,Luke,1064,"Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God."
1992,1814,0,Luke,1065,"Then fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea."
1993,1815,0,Luke,1066,"And all those who heard them kept them in their hearts, saying, &ldquo;What kind of child will this be?&rdquo; And the hand of the Lord was with him."
1994,1816,0,Luke,1067,"Now his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:"
1995,1817,0,Luke,1068,"&ldquo;Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,"
1996,1818,0,Luke,1069,"and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,"
1997,1819,0,Luke,1070,"as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began,"
1998,1820,0,Luke,1071,"that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,"
1999,1821,0,Luke,1072,"to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,"
2000,1822,0,Luke,1073,the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:
2001,1823,0,Luke,1074,"To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,"
2002,1824,0,Luke,1075,in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
2003,1825,0,Luke,1076,"and you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways.&rdquo;"
2004,1826,0,Luke,1077,"to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,"
2005,1827,0,Luke,1078,"through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;"
2006,1828,0,Luke,1079,"to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.&rdquo;"
2007,1829,0,Luke,1080,"So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel."
2008,1830,0,Luke,2001,And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.
2009,1831,0,Luke,2002,This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
2010,1832,0,Luke,2003,"So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city."
2011,1833,0,Luke,2004,"Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,"
2012,1834,0,Luke,2005,"to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child."
2013,1835,0,Luke,2006,"So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered."
2014,1836,0,Luke,2007,"And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."
2015,1837,0,Luke,2008,"Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night."
2016,1838,0,Luke,2009,"And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid."
2017,1839,0,Luke,2010,"Then the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people."
2018,1840,0,Luke,2011,"For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."
2019,1841,0,Luke,2012,"And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.&rdquo;"
2020,1842,0,Luke,2013,And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
2021,1843,0,Luke,2014,"&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!&rdquo; "
2022,1844,0,Luke,2015,"So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo;"
2023,1845,0,Luke,2016,"And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger."
2024,1846,0,Luke,2017,"Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child."
2025,1847,0,Luke,2018,And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
2026,1848,0,Luke,2019,But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
2027,1849,0,Luke,2020,"Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them."
2028,1850,0,Luke,2021,"And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called JESUS, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb."
2029,1851,0,Luke,2022,"Now when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord"
2030,1852,0,Luke,2023,"(as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the LORD&rdquo;), "
2031,1853,0,Luke,2024,"and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo; "
2032,1854,0,Luke,2025,"And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him."
2033,1855,0,Luke,2026,"And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ."
2034,1856,0,Luke,2027,"So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the law,"
2035,1857,0,Luke,2028,he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:
2036,1858,0,Luke,2029,"&ldquo;Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word;"
2037,1859,0,Luke,2030,for my eyes have seen Your salvation
2038,1860,0,Luke,2031,"which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,"
2039,1861,0,Luke,2032,"a light to bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.&rdquo;"
2040,1862,0,Luke,2033,And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him.
2041,1863,0,Luke,2034,"Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, &ldquo;Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against"
2042,1864,0,Luke,2035,"(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.&rdquo;"
2043,1865,0,Luke,2036,"Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;"
2044,1866,0,Luke,2037,"and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day."
2045,1867,0,Luke,2038,"And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
2046,1868,0,Luke,2039,"So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth."
2047,1869,0,Luke,2040,"And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him."
2048,1870,0,Luke,2041,His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
2049,1871,0,Luke,2042,"And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast."
2050,1872,0,Luke,2043,"When they had finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it;"
2051,1873,0,Luke,2044,"but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day&rsquo;s journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances."
2052,1874,0,Luke,2045,"So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him."
2053,1875,0,Luke,2046,"Now so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions."
2054,1876,0,Luke,2047,And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.
2055,1877,0,Luke,2048,"So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, &ldquo;Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.&rdquo;"
2056,1878,0,Luke,2049,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;"
2057,1879,0,Luke,2050,But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.
2058,1880,0,Luke,2051,"Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, but His mother kept all these things in her heart."
2059,1881,0,Luke,2052,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."
2060,1882,0,Luke,3001,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,"
2061,1883,0,Luke,3002,"while Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness."
2062,1884,0,Luke,3003,"And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,"
2063,1885,0,Luke,3004,"as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: &ldquo;Prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight."
2064,1886,0,Luke,3005,"Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill brought low; the crooked places shall be made straight and the rough ways smooth;"
2065,1887,0,Luke,3006,"and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.&rdquo;"
2066,1888,0,Luke,3007,"Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, &ldquo;Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
2067,1889,0,Luke,3008,"Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham as our father.&rsquo; For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
2068,1890,0,Luke,3009,"And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;"
2069,1891,0,Luke,3010,"So the people asked him, saying, &ldquo;What shall we do then?&rdquo;"
2070,1892,0,Luke,3011,"He answered and said to them, &ldquo;He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.&rdquo;"
2071,1893,0,Luke,3012,"Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, what shall we do?&rdquo;"

2073,1895,0,Luke,3014,"Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying, &ldquo;And what shall we do?&rdquo; So he said to them, &ldquo;Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.&rdquo;"
2074,1896,0,Luke,3015,"Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ or not,"
2075,1897,0,Luke,3016,"John answered, saying to all, &ldquo;I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."

2077,1899,0,Luke,3018,And with many other exhortations he preached to the people.
2078,1900,0,Luke,3019,"But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,"
2079,1901,0,Luke,3020,"also added this, above all, that he shut John up in prison."

2130,1952,0,Luke,4033,"Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,"

2133,1955,0,Luke,4036,"Then they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, &ldquo;What a word this is! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.&rdquo;"
2134,1956,0,Luke,4037,And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
2135,1957,0,Luke,4038,"Now He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon&rsquo;s house. But Simon&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother was sick with a high fever, and they made request of Him concerning her."
2136,1958,0,Luke,4039,"So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them."
2137,1959,0,Luke,4040,"When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them."
2138,1960,0,Luke,4041,"And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of God!&rdquo; And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ."
2139,1961,0,Luke,4042,"Now when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowd sought Him and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from leaving them;"
2140,1962,0,Luke,4043,"but He said to them, &ldquo;I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this purpose I have been sent.&rdquo;"
2141,1963,0,Luke,4044,And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. 
2142,1964,0,Luke,5001,"So it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,"
2143,1965,0,Luke,5002,"and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets."
2144,1966,0,Luke,5003,"Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon&rsquo;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat."
2145,1967,0,Luke,5004,"When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, &ldquo;Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&rdquo;"
2146,1968,0,Luke,5005,"But Simon answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.&rdquo;"
2147,1969,0,Luke,5006,"And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking."
2148,1970,0,Luke,5007,"So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink."
2149,1971,0,Luke,5008,"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, &ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!&rdquo;"
2150,1972,0,Luke,5009,"For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;"
2151,1973,0,Luke,5010,"and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.&rdquo;"
2152,1974,0,Luke,5011,"So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him."
2153,1975,0,Luke,5012,"And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&rdquo;"
2154,1976,0,Luke,5013,"Then He put out His hand and touched him, saying, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed.&rdquo; Immediately the leprosy left him."
2155,1977,0,Luke,5014,"And He charged him to tell no one, &ldquo;But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded.&rdquo;"
2156,1978,0,Luke,5015,"However, the report went around concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities."
2157,1979,0,Luke,5016,So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.
2158,1980,0,Luke,5017,"Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them. "
2159,1981,0,Luke,5018,"Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him."
2160,1983,0,Luke,5020,"When He saw their faith, He said to him, &ldquo;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&rdquo;"
2161,1984,0,Luke,5021,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &ldquo;Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&rdquo;"
2162,1985,0,Luke,5022,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning in your hearts?"
2163,1986,0,Luke,5023,"Which is easier, to say, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven you,&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Rise up and walk&rsquo;?"
2164,1987,0,Luke,5024,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins&rdquo; &ndash; He said to the man who was paralyzed, &ldquo;I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&rdquo;"

2168,1991,0,Luke,5028,"So he left all, rose up, and followed Him."
2169,1992,0,Luke,5029,Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.
2170,1993,0,Luke,5030,"And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, &ldquo;Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;"
2171,1994,0,Luke,5031,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
2172,1995,0,Luke,5032,"I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&rdquo;"
2173,1996,0,Luke,5033,"Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?&rdquo;"

2175,1998,0,Luke,5035,"But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.&rdquo;"
2176,1999,0,Luke,5036,"Then He spoke a parable to them: &ldquo;No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old."

2187,2010,0,Luke,6008,"But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, &ldquo;Arise and stand here.&rdquo; And he arose and stood."
2188,2011,0,Luke,6009,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy?&rdquo; "
2189,2012,0,Luke,6010,"And when He had looked around at them all, He said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo; And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other. "

2234,2057,0,Luke,7006,"Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, &ldquo;Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof."
2235,2058,0,Luke,7007,"Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed."
2236,2059,0,Luke,7008,"For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; and he goes; and to another, &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; and he comes; and to my servant, &lsquo;Do this,&rsquo; and he does it.&rdquo;"
2237,2060,0,Luke,7009,"When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, &ldquo;I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!&rdquo;"
2238,2061,0,Luke,7010,"And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick. "
2239,2062,0,Luke,7011,"Now it happened, the day after, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd."
2240,2063,0,Luke,7012,"And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her."
2241,2064,0,Luke,7013,"When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, &ldquo;Do not weep.&rdquo;"
2242,2065,0,Luke,7014,"Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, &ldquo;Young man, I say to you, arise.&rdquo;"
2243,2066,0,Luke,7015,So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother.
2244,2067,0,Luke,7016,"Then fear came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, &ldquo;A great prophet has risen up among us&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;God has visited His people.&rdquo;"
2245,2068,0,Luke,7017,And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.
2246,2069,0,Luke,7018,Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.
2247,2070,0,Luke,7019,"And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?&rdquo;"
2248,2071,0,Luke,7020,"When the men had come to Him, they said, &ldquo;John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, &lsquo;Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2249,2072,0,Luke,7021,"And that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight."
2250,2073,0,Luke,7022,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them."
2251,2074,0,Luke,7023,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.
2252,2075,0,Luke,7024,"When the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
2253,2076,0,Luke,7025,"But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings&rsquo; courts."
2254,2077,0,Luke,7026,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet."
2255,2078,0,Luke,7027,"This is he of whom it is written: &lsquo;Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.&rsquo; "
2256,2079,0,Luke,7028,"For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.&rdquo;"
2257,2080,0,Luke,7029,"And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John."
2258,2081,0,Luke,7030,"But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the will of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him."
2259,2082,0,Luke,7031,"And the Lord said, &ldquo;To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?"
2260,2083,0,Luke,7032,"They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: &lsquo;We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not weep.&rsquo;"
2261,2084,0,Luke,7033,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, &lsquo;He has a demon.&rsquo;"
2262,2085,0,Luke,7034,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, &lsquo;Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!&rsquo;"
2263,2086,0,Luke,7035,"But wisdom is justified by all her children.&rdquo;"
2264,2087,0,Luke,7036,"Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, and sat down to eat."
2265,2088,0,Luke,7037,"And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,"
2266,2089,0,Luke,7038,"and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil."
2267,2090,0,Luke,7039,"Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, &ldquo;This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.&rdquo;"
2268,2091,0,Luke,7040,"And Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Simon, I have something to say to you.&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Teacher, say it.&rdquo;"
2269,2092,0,Luke,7041,"&ldquo;There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty."
2270,2093,0,Luke,7042,"And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?&rdquo;"
2271,2094,0,Luke,7043,"Simon answered and said, &ldquo;I suppose the one whom he forgave more.&rdquo; And He said to him, &ldquo;You have rightly judged.&rdquo;"
2272,2095,0,Luke,7044,"Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, &ldquo;Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head."
2273,2096,0,Luke,7045,"You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in."
2274,2097,0,Luke,7046,"You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil."
2275,2098,0,Luke,7047,"Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.&rdquo;"
2276,2099,0,Luke,7048,"Then He said to her, &ldquo;Your sins are forgiven.&rdquo;"
2277,2100,0,Luke,7049,"And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, &ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&rdquo;"
2278,2101,0,Luke,7050,"Then He said to the woman, &ldquo;Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.&rdquo;"
2279,2102,0,Luke,8001,"Now it came to pass, afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with Him,"
2280,2103,0,Luke,8002,"and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities &ndash; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,"
2281,2104,0,Luke,8003,"and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod&rsquo;s steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for Him from their substance."
2282,2105,0,Luke,8004,"And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable:"
2283,2106,0,Luke,8005,"&ldquo;A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it."
2284,2107,0,Luke,8006,"Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture."
2285,2108,0,Luke,8007,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it."
2286,2109,0,Luke,8008,"But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.&rdquo; When He had said these things He cried, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;"
2287,2110,0,Luke,8009,"Then His disciples asked Him, saying, &ldquo;What does this parable mean?&rdquo;"
2288,2111,0,Luke,8010,"And He said, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is given in parables, that &lsquo;Seeing they may not see, And hearing they may not understand.&rsquo; "
2289,2112,0,Luke,8011,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
2290,2113,0,Luke,8012,"Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
2291,2114,0,Luke,8013,"But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away."
2292,2115,0,Luke,8014,"Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity."
2293,2116,0,Luke,8015,"But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience."
2294,2117,0,Luke,8016,"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light."
2295,2118,0,Luke,8017,"For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light."
2296,2119,0,Luke,8018,"Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken from him.&rdquo;"
2297,2120,0,Luke,8019,"Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd."
2298,2121,0,Luke,8020,"And it was told Him by some, who said, &ldquo;Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.&rdquo;"
2299,2122,0,Luke,8021,"But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.&rdquo;"
2300,2123,0,Luke,8022,"Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, &ldquo;Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.&rdquo; And they launched out."
2301,2124,0,Luke,8023,"But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy."
2302,2125,0,Luke,8024,"And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, &ldquo;Master, Master, we are perishing!&rdquo; Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm."
2303,2126,0,Luke,8025,"But He said to them, &ldquo;Where is your faith?&rdquo; And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, &ldquo;Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!&rdquo;"
2304,2127,0,Luke,8026,"Then they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee."
2305,2128,0,Luke,8027,"And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs."
2306,2129,0,Luke,8028,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, &ldquo;What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!&rdquo;"
2307,2130,0,Luke,8029,"For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness."
2308,2131,0,Luke,8030,"Jesus asked him, saying, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Legion,&rdquo; because many demons had entered him."
2309,2132,0,Luke,8031,And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.
2310,2133,0,Luke,8032,Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.
2311,2134,0,Luke,8033,"Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned."
2312,2135,0,Luke,8034,"When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country."
2313,2136,0,Luke,8035,"Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid."
2314,2137,0,Luke,8036,They also who had seen it told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was healed.
2315,2138,0,Luke,8037,"Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned."
2316,2139,0,Luke,8038,"Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,"
2317,2140,0,Luke,8039,"&ldquo;Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you.&rdquo; And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him."
2318,2141,0,Luke,8040,"So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him."
2319,2142,0,Luke,8041,"And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; feet and begged Him to come to his house,"
2320,2143,0,Luke,8042,"for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him."
2321,2144,0,Luke,8043,"Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any,"
2322,2145,0,Luke,8044,came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.
2323,2146,0,Luke,8045,"And Jesus said, &ldquo;Who touched Me?&rdquo; When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, &ldquo;Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, &lsquo;Who touched Me?&rsquo;&rdquo; "
2324,2147,0,Luke,8046,"But Jesus said, &ldquo;Somebody touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.&rdquo;"
2325,2148,0,Luke,8047,"Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately."
2326,2149,0,Luke,8048,"And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.&rdquo;"
2327,2150,0,Luke,8049,"While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue&rsquo;s house, saying to him, &ldquo;Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.&rdquo; "
2328,2151,0,Luke,8050,"But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.&rdquo;"
2329,2152,0,Luke,8051,"When He came into the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl."
2330,2153,0,Luke,8052,"Now all wept and mourned for her; but He said, &ldquo;Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.&rdquo;"
2331,2154,0,Luke,8053,"And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead."
2332,2155,0,Luke,8054,"But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying, &ldquo;Little girl, arise.&rdquo;"
2333,2156,0,Luke,8055,"Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given something to eat."
2334,2157,0,Luke,8056,"And her parents were astonished, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened."
2335,2158,0,Luke,9001,"Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases."
2336,2159,0,Luke,9002,He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
2337,2160,0,Luke,9003,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have two tunics apiece."
2338,2161,0,Luke,9004,"Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart."
2339,2162,0,Luke,9005,"And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them.&rdquo;"
2340,2163,0,Luke,9006,"So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere."
2341,2164,0,Luke,9007,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,"
2342,2165,0,Luke,9008,"and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again."
2343,2166,0,Luke,9009,"Herod said, &ldquo;John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?&rdquo; So he sought to see Him."
2344,2167,0,Luke,9010,"And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."
2345,2168,0,Luke,9011,"But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing."
2346,2169,0,Luke,9012,"When the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, &ldquo;Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.&rdquo;"
2347,2170,0,Luke,9013,"But He said to them, &ldquo;You give them something to eat.&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.&rdquo;"
2348,2171,0,Luke,9014,"For there were about five thousand men. Then He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Make them sit down in groups of fifty.&rdquo;"
2349,2172,0,Luke,9015,"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
2350,2173,0,Luke,9016,"Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude."
2351,2174,0,Luke,9017,"So they all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them."
2352,2175,0,Luke,9018,"And it happened, as He was alone praying, that His disciples joined Him, and He asked them, saying, &ldquo;Who do the crowds say that I am?&rdquo;"
2353,2176,0,Luke,9019,"So they answered and said, &ldquo;John the Baptist, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.&rdquo;"
2354,2177,0,Luke,9020,"He said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo; Peter answered and said, &ldquo;The Christ of God.&rdquo;"
2355,2178,0,Luke,9021,"And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,"
2356,2179,0,Luke,9022,"saying, &ldquo;The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.&rdquo;"
2357,2180,0,Luke,9023,"Then He said to them all, &ldquo;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me."
2358,2181,0,Luke,9024,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it."
2359,2182,0,Luke,9025,"For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?"
2360,2183,0,Luke,9026,"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father&rsquo;s, and of the holy angels."
2361,2184,0,Luke,9027,"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
2362,2185,0,Luke,9028,"Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray."
2363,2186,0,Luke,9029,"As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening."
2364,2187,0,Luke,9030,"And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,"
2365,2188,0,Luke,9031,who appeared in glory and spoke of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
2366,2189,0,Luke,9032,"But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him."
2367,2190,0,Luke,9033,"Then it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&rdquo; &ndash; not knowing what he said."
2368,2191,0,Luke,9034,"While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the cloud."
2369,2192,0,Luke,9035,"And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!&rdquo;"
2370,2193,0,Luke,9036,"When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen."
2371,2194,0,Luke,9037,"Now it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him."
2372,2195,0,Luke,9038,"Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, I implore You, look on my son, for he is my only child."
2373,2196,0,Luke,9039,"And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him."
2374,2197,0,Luke,9040,"So I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.&rdquo;"
2375,2198,0,Luke,9041,"Then Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.&rdquo;"
2376,2199,0,Luke,9042,"And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father."
2377,2200,0,Luke,9043,"And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,"
2378,2201,0,Luke,9044,"&ldquo;Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.&rdquo;"
2379,2202,0,Luke,9045,"But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying."
2380,2203,0,Luke,9046,Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest.
2381,2204,0,Luke,9047,"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by Him,"

2383,2206,0,Luke,9049,"Now John answered and said, &ldquo;Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.&rdquo;"

2390,2213,0,Luke,9056,"For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men&rsquo;s lives but to save them.&rdquo; And they went to another village."
2391,2214,0,Luke,9057,"Now it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.&rdquo;"
2392,2215,0,Luke,9058,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.&rdquo;"

2481,2304,0,Luke,11043,Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
2482,2305,0,Luke,11044,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like graves which are not seen, and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.&rdquo;"

2486,2309,0,Luke,11048,"In fact, you bear witness that you approve the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs."

2535,2358,0,Luke,12043,Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
2536,2359,0,Luke,12044,"Truly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he has."
2537,2360,0,Luke,12045,"But if that servant says in his heart, &lsquo;My master is delaying his coming,&rsquo; and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk,"
2538,2361,0,Luke,12046,"the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."
2539,2362,0,Luke,12047,"And that servant who knew his master&rsquo;s will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."
2540,2363,0,Luke,12048,"But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more."
2541,2364,0,Luke,12049,"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!"
2542,2365,0,Luke,12050,"But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am till it is accomplished!"
2543,2366,0,Luke,12051,"Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but rather division."
2544,2367,0,Luke,12052,"For from now on five in one house will be divided: three against two, and two against three."
2545,2368,0,Luke,12053,"Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.&rdquo;"
2546,2369,0,Luke,12054,"Then He also said to the multitudes, &ldquo;Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, &lsquo;A shower is coming&rsquo;; and so it is."
2547,2370,0,Luke,12055,"And when you see the south wind blow, you say, &lsquo;There will be hot weather&rsquo;; and there is."
2548,2371,0,Luke,12056,"Hypocrites! You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth, but how is it you do not discern this time?"
2549,2372,0,Luke,12057,"Yes, and why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?"
2550,2373,0,Luke,12058,"When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make every effort along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison."
2551,2374,0,Luke,12059,"I tell you, you shall not depart from there till you have paid the very last mite.&rdquo;"
2552,2375,0,Luke,13001,There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
2553,2376,0,Luke,13002,"And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?"
2554,2377,0,Luke,13003,"I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish."
2555,2378,0,Luke,13004,"Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem?"
2556,2379,0,Luke,13005,"I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;"
2557,2380,0,Luke,13006,"He also spoke this parable: &ldquo;A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none."
2558,2381,0,Luke,13007,"Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, &lsquo;Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground?&rsquo;"
2559,2382,0,Luke,13008,"But he answered and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it."
2560,2383,0,Luke,13009,"And if it bears fruit, well. But if not, after that you can cut it down.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2561,2384,0,Luke,13010,Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
2562,2385,0,Luke,13011,"And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up."
2563,2386,0,Luke,13012,"But when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.&rdquo;"
2564,2387,0,Luke,13013,"And He laid His hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God."
2565,2388,0,Luke,13014,"But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath; and he said to the crowd, &ldquo;There are six days on which men ought to work; therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;"
2566,2389,0,Luke,13015,"The Lord then answered him and said, &ldquo;Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?"
2567,2390,0,Luke,13016,"So ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound &ndash; think of it &ndash; for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?&rdquo;"
2568,2391,0,Luke,13017,"And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him."
2569,2392,0,Luke,13018,"Then He said, &ldquo;What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?"
2570,2393,0,Luke,13019,"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.&rdquo;"
2571,2394,0,Luke,13020,"And again He said, &ldquo;To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?"
2572,2395,0,Luke,13021,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.&rdquo;"
2573,2396,0,Luke,13022,"And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."
2574,2397,0,Luke,13023,"Then one said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, are there few who are saved?&rdquo; And He said to them,"
2575,2398,0,Luke,13024,"&ldquo;Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
2576,2399,0,Luke,13025,"When once the Master of the house has risen up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, open for us,&rsquo; and He will answer and say to you, &lsquo;I do not know you, where you are from,&rsquo;"
2577,2400,0,Luke,13026,"then you will begin to say, &lsquo;We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.&rsquo;"
2578,2401,0,Luke,13027,"But He will say, &lsquo;I tell you I do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.&rsquo;"
2579,2402,0,Luke,13028,"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out."
2580,2403,0,Luke,13029,"They will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God."
2581,2404,0,Luke,13030,"And indeed there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.&rdquo;"
2582,2405,0,Luke,13031,"On that very day some Pharisees came, saying to Him, &ldquo;Get out and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You.&rdquo;"
2583,2406,0,Luke,13032,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Go, tell that fox, &lsquo;Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.&rsquo;"
2584,2407,0,Luke,13033,"Nevertheless I must journey today, tomorrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem."
2585,2408,0,Luke,13034,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!"
2586,2409,0,Luke,13035,"See! Your house is left to you desolate; and assuredly, I say to you, you shall not see Me until the time comes when you say, &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2587,2410,0,Luke,14001,"Now it happened, as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, that they watched Him closely."
2588,2411,0,Luke,14002,"And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy."
2589,2412,0,Luke,14003,"And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, &ldquo;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&rdquo; "
2590,2413,0,Luke,14004,"But they kept silent. And He took him and healed him, and let him go."
2591,2414,0,Luke,14005,"Then He answered them, saying, &ldquo;Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?&rdquo;"
2592,2415,0,Luke,14006,And they could not answer Him regarding these things.
2593,2416,0,Luke,14007,"So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them:"
2594,2417,0,Luke,14008,"&ldquo;When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;"
2595,2418,0,Luke,14009,"and he who invited you and him come and say to you, &lsquo;Give place to this man,&rsquo; and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place."
2596,2419,0,Luke,14010,"But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, &lsquo;Friend, go up higher.&rsquo; Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you."
2597,2420,0,Luke,14011,"For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&rdquo;"
2598,2421,0,Luke,14012,"Then He also said to him who invited Him, &ldquo;When you give a dinner or a supper, do not ask your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid."
2599,2422,0,Luke,14013,"But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind."
2600,2423,0,Luke,14014,"And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.&rdquo;"
2601,2424,0,Luke,14015,"Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, &ldquo;Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!&rdquo;"
2602,2425,0,Luke,14016,"Then He said to him, &ldquo;A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,"
2603,2426,0,Luke,14017,"and sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, &lsquo;Come, for all things are now ready.&rsquo;"
2604,2427,0,Luke,14018,"But they all with one accord began to make excuses. The first said to him, &lsquo;I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.&rsquo;"
2605,2428,0,Luke,14019,"And another said, &lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.&rsquo;"
2606,2429,0,Luke,14020,"Still another said, &lsquo;I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.&rsquo;"
2607,2430,0,Luke,14021,"So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, &lsquo;Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.&rsquo;"
2608,2431,0,Luke,14022,"And the servant said, &lsquo;Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.&rsquo;"
2609,2432,0,Luke,14023,"Then the master said to the servant, &lsquo;Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."
2610,2433,0,Luke,14024,"&rsquo;For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2611,2434,0,Luke,14025,"Now great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them,"
2612,2435,0,Luke,14026,"&ldquo;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple."
2613,2436,0,Luke,14027,And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
2614,2437,0,Luke,14028,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it &ndash; "
2615,2438,0,Luke,14029,"lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,"
2616,2439,0,Luke,14030,"saying, &lsquo;This man began to build and was not able to finish.&rsquo;"
2617,2440,0,Luke,14031,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?"
2618,2441,0,Luke,14032,"Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace."
2619,2442,0,Luke,14033,"So likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple."
2620,2443,0,Luke,14034,"Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?"
2621,2444,0,Luke,14035,"It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, but men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;"
2622,2445,0,Luke,15001,Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him.
2623,2446,0,Luke,15002,"And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, &ldquo;This Man receives sinners and eats with them.&rdquo;"
2624,2447,0,Luke,15003,"So He spoke this parable to them, saying:"
2625,2448,0,Luke,15004,"&ldquo;What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?"
2626,2449,0,Luke,15005,"And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
2627,2450,0,Luke,15006,"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, &lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!&rsquo;"
2628,2451,0,Luke,15007,I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.
2629,2452,0,Luke,15008,"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?"
2630,2453,0,Luke,15009,"And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, &lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!&rsquo;"
2631,2454,0,Luke,15010,"Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&rdquo;"
2632,2455,0,Luke,15011,"Then He said: &ldquo;A certain man had two sons."
2633,2456,0,Luke,15012,"And the younger of them said to his father, &lsquo;Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.&rsquo; So he divided to them his livelihood."
2634,2457,0,Luke,15013,"And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living."
2635,2458,0,Luke,15014,"But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want."
2636,2459,0,Luke,15015,"Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."
2637,2460,0,Luke,15016,"And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything."
2638,2461,0,Luke,15017,"But when he came to himself, he said, &lsquo;How many of my father&rsquo;s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
2639,2462,0,Luke,15018,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,"
2640,2463,0,Luke,15019,"and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
2641,2464,0,Luke,15020,"And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him."
2642,2465,0,Luke,15021,"And the son said to him, &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.&rsquo;"
2643,2466,0,Luke,15022,"But the father said to his servants, &lsquo;Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet."
2644,2467,0,Luke,15023,"And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;"
2645,2468,0,Luke,15024,"for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&rsquo; And they began to be merry."
2646,2469,0,Luke,15025,"Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing."
2647,2470,0,Luke,15026,So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
2648,2471,0,Luke,15027,"And he said to him, &lsquo;Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.&rsquo;"
2649,2472,0,Luke,15028,But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.
2650,2473,0,Luke,15029,"So he answered and said to his father, &lsquo;Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends."
2651,2474,0,Luke,15030,"But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.&rsquo;"
2652,2475,0,Luke,15031,"And he said to him, &lsquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours."
2653,2476,0,Luke,15032,"It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2654,2477,0,Luke,16001,"He also said to His disciples: &ldquo;There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods."
2655,2478,0,Luke,16002,"So he called him and said to him, &lsquo;What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.&rsquo;"
2656,2479,0,Luke,16003,"Then the steward said within himself, &lsquo;What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg."
2657,2480,0,Luke,16004,"I have resolved what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.&rsquo;"
2658,2481,0,Luke,16005,"So he called every one of his master&rsquo;s debtors to him, and said to the first, &lsquo;How much do you owe my master?&rsquo;"
2659,2482,0,Luke,16006,"And he said, &lsquo;A hundred measures of oil.&rsquo; So he said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&rsquo;"
2660,2483,0,Luke,16007,"Then he said to another, &lsquo;And how much do you owe?&rsquo; So he said, &lsquo;A hundred measures of wheat.&rsquo; And he said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and write eighty.&rsquo;"
2661,2484,0,Luke,16008,So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light.
2662,2485,0,Luke,16009,"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail, they may receive you into an everlasting home."
2663,2486,0,Luke,16010,"He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much."
2664,2487,0,Luke,16011,"Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?"
2665,2488,0,Luke,16012,"And if you have not been faithful in what is another man&rsquo;s, who will give you what is your own?"
2666,2489,0,Luke,16013,"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&rdquo;"
2667,2490,0,Luke,16014,"Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him."
2668,2491,0,Luke,16015,"And He said to them, &ldquo;You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God."
2669,2492,0,Luke,16016,"The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it."
2670,2493,0,Luke,16017,And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fail.
2671,2494,0,Luke,16018,"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband commits adultery."
2672,2495,0,Luke,16019,There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.
2673,2496,0,Luke,16020,"But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,"
2674,2497,0,Luke,16021,"desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."
2675,2498,0,Luke,16022,"So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried."
2676,2499,0,Luke,16023,"And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
2677,2500,0,Luke,16024,"Then he cried and said, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.&rsquo;"
2678,2501,0,Luke,16025,"But Abraham said, &lsquo;Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented."
2679,2502,0,Luke,16026,"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.&rsquo;"
2680,2503,0,Luke,16027,"Then he said, &lsquo;I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father&rsquo;s house,"
2681,2504,0,Luke,16028,"for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.&rsquo;"
2682,2505,0,Luke,16029,"Abraham said to him, &lsquo;They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.&rsquo;"
2683,2506,0,Luke,16030,"And he said, &lsquo;No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&rsquo;"
2684,2507,0,Luke,16031,"But he said to him, &lsquo;If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2685,2508,0,Luke,17001,"Then He said to the disciples, &ldquo;It is impossible that no offenses should come, but woe to him through whom they do come!"
2686,2509,0,Luke,17002,"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
2687,2510,0,Luke,17003,"Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him."
2688,2511,0,Luke,17004,"And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, &lsquo;I repent,&rsquo; you shall forgive him."
2689,2512,0,Luke,17005,"And the apostles said to the Lord, &ldquo;Increase our faith.&rdquo;"
2690,2513,0,Luke,17006,"So the Lord said, &ldquo;If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, &lsquo;Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,&rsquo; and it would obey you."
2691,2514,0,Luke,17007,"And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, &lsquo;Come at once and sit down to eat&rsquo;?"
2692,2515,0,Luke,17008,"But will he not rather say to him, &lsquo;Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink&rsquo;?"
2693,2516,0,Luke,17009,Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. 
2694,2517,0,Luke,17010,"So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, &lsquo;We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.&rsquo; "
2695,2518,0,Luke,17011,Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
2696,2519,0,Luke,17012,"Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off."
2697,2520,0,Luke,17013,"And they lifted up their voices and said, &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&rdquo;"
2698,2521,0,Luke,17014,"So when He saw them, He said to them, &ldquo;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed."
2699,2522,0,Luke,17015,"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God,"
2700,2523,0,Luke,17016,"and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan."
2701,2524,0,Luke,17017,"So Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?"
2702,2525,0,Luke,17018,Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?
2703,2526,0,Luke,17019,"And He said to him, &ldquo;Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.&rdquo;"
2704,2527,0,Luke,17020,"Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, &ldquo;The kingdom of God does not come with observation;"
2705,2528,0,Luke,17021,"nor will they say, &lsquo;See here!&rsquo; or &lsquo;See there!&rsquo; For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you."
2706,2529,0,Luke,17022,"Then He said to the disciples, &ldquo;The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it."
2707,2530,0,Luke,17023,"And they will say to you, &lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; Do not go after them or follow them."
2708,2531,0,Luke,17024,"For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so also the Son of Man will be in His day."
2709,2532,0,Luke,17025,But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
2710,2533,0,Luke,17026,"And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:"
2711,2534,0,Luke,17027,"They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all."
2712,2535,0,Luke,17028,"Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;"
2713,2536,0,Luke,17029,but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
2714,2537,0,Luke,17030,Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
2715,2538,0,Luke,17031,"In that day, he who is on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not turn back."
2716,2539,0,Luke,17032,"Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife."
2717,2540,0,Luke,17033,"Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it."
2718,2541,0,Luke,17034,"I tell you, in that night there will be two men in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left."
2719,2542,0,Luke,17035,Two women will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.
2720,2543,0,Luke,17036,Two men will be in the field: the one will be taken and the other left. 
2721,2544,0,Luke,17037,"And they answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Where, Lord?&rdquo; So He said to them, &ldquo;Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.&rdquo;"
2722,2545,0,Luke,18001,"Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not lose heart,"
2723,2546,0,Luke,18002,"saying: &ldquo;There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man."
2724,2547,0,Luke,18003,"Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, &lsquo;Get justice for me from my adversary.&rsquo;"
2725,2548,0,Luke,18004,"And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, &lsquo;Though I do not fear God nor regard man,"
2726,2549,0,Luke,18005,"yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2727,2550,0,Luke,18006,"Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Hear what the unjust judge said."
2728,2551,0,Luke,18007,"And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?"
2729,2552,0,Luke,18008,"I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?&rdquo;"
2730,2553,0,Luke,18009,"Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
2731,2554,0,Luke,18010,"&ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector."
2732,2555,0,Luke,18011,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, &lsquo;God, I thank You that I am not like other men &ndash; extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector."
2733,2556,0,Luke,18012,"I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.&rsquo;"
2734,2557,0,Luke,18013,"And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me a sinner!&rsquo;"
2735,2558,0,Luke,18014,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&rdquo;"
2736,2559,0,Luke,18015,"Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
2737,2560,0,Luke,18016,"But Jesus called them to Him and said, &ldquo;Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God."
2738,2561,0,Luke,18017,"Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.&rdquo;"
2739,2562,0,Luke,18018,"Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;"
2740,2563,0,Luke,18019,"So Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God."
2741,2564,0,Luke,18020,"You know the commandments: &lsquo;Do not commit adultery,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not murder,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not steal,&rsquo; &lsquo;Do not bear false witness,&rsquo; &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2742,2565,0,Luke,18021,"And he said, &ldquo;All these things I have kept from my youth.&rdquo;"
2743,2566,0,Luke,18022,"So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, &ldquo;You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&rdquo;"
2744,2567,0,Luke,18023,"But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich."
2745,2568,0,Luke,18024,"And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, &ldquo;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"
2746,2569,0,Luke,18025,"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
2747,2570,0,Luke,18026,"And those who heard it said, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo;"
2748,2571,0,Luke,18027,"But He said, &ldquo;The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.&rdquo;"
2749,2572,0,Luke,18028,"Then Peter said, &ldquo;See, we have left all and followed You.&rdquo;"
2750,2573,0,Luke,18029,"So He said to them, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,"
2751,2574,0,Luke,18030,"who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.&rdquo;"
2752,2575,0,Luke,18031,"Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, &ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished."
2753,2576,0,Luke,18032,For He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.
2754,2577,0,Luke,18033,"They will scourge Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.&rdquo;"
2755,2578,0,Luke,18034,"But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken."
2756,2579,0,Luke,18035,"Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging."
2757,2580,0,Luke,18036,"And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant."
2758,2581,0,Luke,18037,So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
2759,2582,0,Luke,18038,"And he cried out, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;"
2760,2583,0,Luke,18039,"Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo;"
2761,2584,0,Luke,18040,"So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,"
2762,2585,0,Luke,18041,"saying, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Lord, that I may receive my sight.&rdquo;"
2763,2586,0,Luke,18042,"Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.&rdquo;"
2764,2587,0,Luke,18043,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God."
2765,2588,0,Luke,19001,Then Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
2766,2589,0,Luke,19002,"Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich."
2767,2590,0,Luke,19003,"And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature."
2768,2591,0,Luke,19004,"So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way."
2769,2592,0,Luke,19005,"And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, &ldquo;Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.&rdquo;"
2770,2593,0,Luke,19006,"So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully."
2771,2594,0,Luke,19007,"But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, &ldquo;He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.&rdquo;"
2772,2595,0,Luke,19008,"Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &ldquo;Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.&rdquo;"
2773,2596,0,Luke,19009,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;"
2774,2597,0,Luke,19010,"for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.&rdquo;"
2775,2598,0,Luke,19011,"Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately."
2776,2599,0,Luke,19012,"Therefore He said: &ldquo;A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return."
2777,2600,0,Luke,19013,"So he called ten of his servants, delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, &lsquo;Do business till I come.&rsquo;"
2778,2601,0,Luke,19014,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, &lsquo;We will not have this man to reign over us.&rsquo;"
2779,2602,0,Luke,19015,"And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
2780,2603,0,Luke,19016,"Then came the first, saying, &lsquo;Master, your mina has earned ten minas.&rsquo;"
2781,2604,0,Luke,19017,"And he said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.&rsquo;"
2782,2605,0,Luke,19018,"And the second came, saying, &lsquo;Master, your mina has earned five minas.&rsquo;"
2783,2606,0,Luke,19019,"Likewise he said to him, &lsquo;You also be over five cities.&rsquo;"
2784,2607,0,Luke,19020,"Then another came, saying, &lsquo;Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief."
2785,2608,0,Luke,19021,"For I feared you, because you are an austere man. You collect what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.&rsquo;"
2786,2609,0,Luke,19022,"And he said to him, &lsquo;Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was an austere man, collecting what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow."
2787,2610,0,Luke,19023,"Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?&rsquo;"
2788,2611,0,Luke,19024,"And he said to those who stood by, &lsquo;Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.&rsquo;"
2789,2612,0,Luke,19025,"(But they said to him, &lsquo;Master, he has ten minas.&rsquo;)"
2790,2613,0,Luke,19026,"&lsquo;For I say to you, that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
2791,2614,0,Luke,19027,"But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2792,2615,0,Luke,19028,"When He had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
2793,2616,0,Luke,19029,"And it came to pass, when He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,"
2794,2617,0,Luke,19030,"saying, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here."
2795,2618,0,Luke,19031,"And if anyone asks you, &lsquo;Why are you loosing it?&rsquo; thus you shall say to him, &lsquo;Because the Lord has need of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
2796,2619,0,Luke,19032,So those who were sent went their way and found it just as He had said to them.
2797,2620,0,Luke,19033,"But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, &ldquo;Why are you loosing the colt?&rdquo;"
2798,2621,0,Luke,19034,"And they said, &ldquo;The Lord has need of him.&rdquo;"
2799,2622,0,Luke,19035,"Then they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their own clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on him."
2800,2623,0,Luke,19036,"And as He went, many spread their clothes on the road."
2801,2624,0,Luke,19037,"Then, as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,"
2802,2625,0,Luke,19038,"saying: &ldquo;&lsquo;Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the LORD!&rsquo; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&rdquo;"
2803,2626,0,Luke,19039,"And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, &ldquo;Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.&rdquo;"
2804,2627,0,Luke,19040,"But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.&rdquo;"
2805,2628,0,Luke,19041,"Now as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,"
2806,2629,0,Luke,19042,"saying, &ldquo;If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes."
2807,2630,0,Luke,19043,"For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and close you in on every side,"
2808,2631,0,Luke,19044,"and level you, and your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.&rdquo;"
2809,2632,0,Luke,19045,"Then He went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, "
2810,2633,0,Luke,19046,"saying to them, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;My house is a house of prayer,&rsquo; but you have made it a &lsquo;den of thieves.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
2811,2634,0,Luke,19047,"And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him,"
2812,2635,0,Luke,19048,"and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to hear Him."
2813,2636,0,Luke,20001,"Now it happened on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted Him"
2814,2637,0,Luke,20002,"and spoke to Him, saying, &ldquo;Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?&rdquo;"
2815,2638,0,Luke,20003,"But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:"
2816,2639,0,Luke,20004,"The baptism of John &ndash; was it from heaven or from men?&rdquo;"
2817,2640,0,Luke,20005,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Why then did you not believe him?&rsquo;"
2818,2641,0,Luke,20006,"But if we say, &lsquo;From men,&rsquo; all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.&rdquo;"
2819,2642,0,Luke,20007,So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
2820,2643,0,Luke,20008,"And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&rdquo;"
2821,2644,0,Luke,20009,"Then He began to tell the people this parable: &ldquo;A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time."
2822,2645,0,Luke,20010,"Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed."
2823,2646,0,Luke,20011,"Again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed."
2824,2647,0,Luke,20012,"And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out."
2825,2648,0,Luke,20013,"Then the owner of the vineyard said, &lsquo;What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Probably they will respect him when they see him.&rsquo;"
2826,2649,0,Luke,20014,"But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, &lsquo;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.&rsquo;"
2827,2650,0,Luke,20015,So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
2828,2651,0,Luke,20016,"He will come and destroy those vinedressers and give the vineyard to others.&rdquo; And when they heard it they said, &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;"
2829,2652,0,Luke,20017,"Then He looked at them and said, &ldquo;What then is this that is written: &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone&rsquo;? "
2830,2653,0,Luke,20018,"Whoever falls on that stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.&rdquo;"
2831,2654,0,Luke,20019,"And the chief priests and the scribes that very hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they feared the people &ndash; for they knew He had spoken this parable against them."
2832,2655,0,Luke,20020,"So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor."
2833,2656,0,Luke,20021,"Then they asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth:"
2834,2657,0,Luke,20022,"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&rdquo;"
2835,2658,0,Luke,20023,"But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, &ldquo;Why do you test Me? "
2836,2659,0,Luke,20024,"Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?&rdquo; They answered and said, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;"
2837,2660,0,Luke,20025,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;"
2838,2661,0,Luke,20026,But they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.
2839,2662,0,Luke,20027,"Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,"
2840,2663,0,Luke,20028,"saying: &ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man&rsquo;s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother."
2841,2664,0,Luke,20029,"Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children."
2842,2665,0,Luke,20030,"And the second took her as wife, and he died childless."
2843,2666,0,Luke,20031,"Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died."
2844,2667,0,Luke,20032,Last of all the woman died also.
2845,2668,0,Luke,20033,"Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her as wife.&rdquo;"
2846,2669,0,Luke,20034,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage."
2847,2670,0,Luke,20035,"But those who are counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;"
2848,2671,0,Luke,20036,"nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."
2849,2672,0,Luke,20037,"But even Moses showed in the burning bush passage that the dead are raised, when he called the Lord &lsquo;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rsquo; "
2850,2673,0,Luke,20038,"For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to Him.&rdquo;"
2851,2674,0,Luke,20039,"Then some of the scribes answered and said, &ldquo;Teacher, You have spoken well.&rdquo;"
2852,2675,0,Luke,20040,But after that they dared not question Him anymore.
2853,2676,0,Luke,20041,"And He said to them, &ldquo;How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?"
2854,2677,0,Luke,20042,"Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms: &lsquo;The LORD said to my Lord, sit at My right hand,"
2855,2678,0,Luke,20043,"till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&rsquo; "
2856,2679,0,Luke,20044,"Therefore David calls Him &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;; how is He then his Son?&rdquo;"
2857,2680,0,Luke,20045,"Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to His disciples,"
2858,2681,0,Luke,20046,"&ldquo;Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts,"
2859,2682,0,Luke,20047,"who devour widows&rsquo; houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.&rdquo;"
2860,2683,0,Luke,21001,"And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,"
2861,2684,0,Luke,21002,and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
2862,2685,0,Luke,21003,"So He said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all;"
2863,2686,0,Luke,21004,"for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.&rdquo;"
2864,2687,0,Luke,21005,"Then, as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,"
2865,2688,0,Luke,21006,"&ldquo;These things which you see &ndash; the days will come in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down.&rdquo;"
2866,2689,0,Luke,21007,"So they asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, but when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things are about to take place?&rdquo;"
2867,2690,0,Luke,21008,"And He said: &ldquo;Take heed that you not be deceived. For many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am He,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;The time has drawn near.&rsquo; Therefore do not go after them."
2868,2691,0,Luke,21009,"But when you hear of wars and commotions, do not be terrified; for these things must come to pass first, but the end will not come immediately.&rdquo;"
2869,2692,0,Luke,21010,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."
2870,2693,0,Luke,21011,"And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven."
2871,2694,0,Luke,21012,"But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers for My name&rsquo;s sake."
2872,2695,0,Luke,21013,But it will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony.
2873,2696,0,Luke,21014,"Therefore settle it in your hearts not to meditate beforehand on what you will answer;"
2874,2697,0,Luke,21015,for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or resist.
2875,2698,0,Luke,21016,"You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death."
2876,2699,0,Luke,21017,"And you will be hated by all for My name&rsquo;s sake."
2877,2700,0,Luke,21018,But not a hair of your head shall be lost.
2878,2701,0,Luke,21019,By your patience possess your souls.
2879,2702,0,Luke,21020,"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near."
2880,2703,0,Luke,21021,"Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the midst of her depart, and let not those who are in the country enter her."
2881,2704,0,Luke,21022,"For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
2882,2705,0,Luke,21023,But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.
2883,2706,0,Luke,21024,"And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."
2884,2707,0,Luke,21025,"And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring;"
2885,2708,0,Luke,21026,"men&rsquo;s hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
2886,2709,0,Luke,21027,Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
2887,2710,0,Luke,21028,"Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.&rdquo;"
2888,2711,0,Luke,21029,"Then He spoke to them a parable: &ldquo;Look at the fig tree, and all the trees."
2889,2712,0,Luke,21030,"When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near."
2890,2713,0,Luke,21031,"So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near."
2891,2714,0,Luke,21032,"Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all things take place."
2892,2715,0,Luke,21033,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away."
2893,2716,0,Luke,21034,"But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly."
2894,2717,0,Luke,21035,For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
2895,2718,0,Luke,21036,"Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo;"
2896,2719,0,Luke,21037,"And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet."
2897,2720,0,Luke,21038,Then early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him.
2898,2721,0,Luke,22001,"Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover."
2899,2722,0,Luke,22002,"And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people."
2900,2723,0,Luke,22003,"Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve."
2901,2724,0,Luke,22004,"So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them."
2902,2725,0,Luke,22005,"And they were glad, and agreed to give him money."
2903,2726,0,Luke,22006,So he promised and sought opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the multitude.
2904,2727,0,Luke,22007,"Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb must be killed."
2905,2728,0,Luke,22008,"And He sent Peter and John, saying, &ldquo;Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.&rdquo;"
2906,2729,0,Luke,22009,"So they said to Him, &ldquo;Where do You want us to prepare?&rdquo;"
2907,2730,0,Luke,22010,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters."
2908,2731,0,Luke,22011,"Then you shall say to the master of the house, &lsquo;The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?&rsquo;"
2909,2732,0,Luke,22012,"Then he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.&rdquo;"
2910,2733,0,Luke,22013,"So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover."
2911,2734,0,Luke,22014,"When the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him."
2912,2735,0,Luke,22015,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;"
2913,2736,0,Luke,22016,"for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
2914,2737,0,Luke,22017,"Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, &ldquo;Take this and divide it among yourselves;"
2915,2738,0,Luke,22018,"for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&rdquo;"
2916,2739,0,Luke,22019,"And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;"
2917,2740,0,Luke,22020,"Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you."
2918,2741,0,Luke,22021,"But behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table."
2919,2742,0,Luke,22022,"And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!&rdquo;"
2920,2743,0,Luke,22023,"Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing."
2921,2744,0,Luke,22024,"Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest."
2922,2745,0,Luke,22025,"And He said to them, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called &lsquo;benefactors.&rsquo;"
2923,2746,0,Luke,22026,"But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves."
2924,2747,0,Luke,22027,"For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves."
2925,2748,0,Luke,22028,But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.
2926,2749,0,Luke,22029,"And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,"
2927,2750,0,Luke,22030,"that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo;"
2928,2751,0,Luke,22031,"And the Lord said, &ldquo;Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat."
2929,2752,0,Luke,22032,"But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.&rdquo;"
2930,2753,0,Luke,22033,"But he said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.&rdquo;"
2931,2754,0,Luke,22034,"Then He said, &ldquo;I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.&rdquo;"
2932,2755,0,Luke,22035,"And He said to them, &ldquo;When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?&rdquo; So they said, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;"
2933,2756,0,Luke,22036,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one."
2934,2757,0,Luke,22037,"For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: &lsquo;And He was numbered with the transgressors.&rsquo; For the things concerning Me have an end.&rdquo;"
2935,2758,0,Luke,22038,"So they said, &ldquo;Lord, look, here are two swords.&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;"
2936,2759,0,Luke,22039,"Coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His disciples also followed Him."
2937,2760,0,Luke,22040,"When He came to the place, He said to them, &ldquo;Pray that you may not enter into temptation.&rdquo;"
2938,2761,0,Luke,22041,"And He was withdrawn from them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,"
2939,2762,0,Luke,22042,"saying, &ldquo;Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.&rdquo;"
2940,2763,0,Luke,22043,"Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him."
2941,2764,0,Luke,22044,"And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. "
2942,2765,0,Luke,22045,"When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow."
2943,2766,0,Luke,22046,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.&rdquo;"
2944,2767,0,Luke,22047,"And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him."
2945,2768,0,Luke,22048,"But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?&rdquo;"
2946,2769,0,Luke,22049,"When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, shall we strike with the sword?&rdquo;"
2947,2770,0,Luke,22050,And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
2948,2771,0,Luke,22051,"But Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;Permit even this.&rdquo; And He touched his ear and healed him."
2949,2772,0,Luke,22052,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, &ldquo;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?"
2950,2773,0,Luke,22053,"When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&rdquo;"
2951,2774,0,Luke,22054,"Having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the high priest&rsquo;s house. But Peter followed at a distance."
2952,2775,0,Luke,22055,"Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them."
2953,2776,0,Luke,22056,"And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, &ldquo;This man was also with Him.&rdquo;"
2954,2777,0,Luke,22057,"But he denied Him, saying, &ldquo;Woman, I do not know Him.&rdquo;"
2955,2778,0,Luke,22058,"And after a little while another saw him and said, &ldquo;You also are of them.&rdquo; But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I am not!&rdquo;"
2956,2779,0,Luke,22059,"Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, &ldquo;Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.&rdquo;"
2957,2780,0,Luke,22060,"But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I do not know what you are saying!&rdquo; Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed."
2958,2781,0,Luke,22061,"And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, &ldquo;Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo;"
2959,2782,0,Luke,22062,So Peter went out and wept bitterly.
2960,2783,0,Luke,22063,Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him.
2961,2784,0,Luke,22064,"And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?&rdquo;"
2962,2785,0,Luke,22065,And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.
2963,2786,0,Luke,22066,"As soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,"
2964,2787,0,Luke,22067,"&ldquo;If You are the Christ, tell us.&rdquo; But He said to them, &ldquo;If I tell you, you will by no means believe."
2965,2788,0,Luke,22068,"And if I also ask you, you will by no means answer Me or let Me go. "
2966,2789,0,Luke,22069,"Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.&rdquo;"
2967,2790,0,Luke,22070,"Then they all said, &ldquo;Are You then the Son of God?&rdquo; So He said to them, &ldquo;You rightly say that I am.&rdquo;"
2968,2791,0,Luke,22071,"And they said, &ldquo;What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.&rdquo;"
2969,2792,0,Luke,23001,Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate.
2970,2793,0,Luke,23002,"And they began to accuse Him, saying, &ldquo;We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.&rdquo;"
2971,2794,0,Luke,23003,"Then Pilate asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; He answered him and said, &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;"
2972,2795,0,Luke,23004,"So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, &ldquo;I find no fault in this Man.&rdquo;"
2973,2796,0,Luke,23005,"But they were the more fierce, saying, &ldquo;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.&rdquo;"
2974,2797,0,Luke,23006,"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean."
2975,2798,0,Luke,23007,"And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time."
2976,2799,0,Luke,23008,"Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him."
2977,2800,0,Luke,23009,"Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing."
2978,2801,0,Luke,23010,And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.
2979,2802,0,Luke,23011,"Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate."
2980,2803,0,Luke,23012,"That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other."
2981,2804,0,Luke,23013,"Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,"
2982,2805,0,Luke,23014,"said to them, &ldquo;You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him;"
2983,2806,0,Luke,23015,"no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him."
2984,2807,0,Luke,23016,"I will therefore chastise Him and release Him&rdquo;"
2985,2808,0,Luke,23017,(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast). 
2986,2809,0,Luke,23018,"And they all cried out at once, saying, &ldquo;Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas&rdquo; &ndash; "
2987,2810,0,Luke,23019,"who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder."
2988,2811,0,Luke,23020,"Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them."
2989,2812,0,Luke,23021,"But they shouted, saying, &ldquo;Crucify Him, crucify Him!&rdquo;"
2990,2813,0,Luke,23022,"Then he said to them the third time, &ldquo;Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go.&rdquo;"
2991,2814,0,Luke,23023,"But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed. "
2992,2815,0,Luke,23024,So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested.
2993,2816,0,Luke,23025,"And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
2994,2817,0,Luke,23026,"Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus."
2995,2818,0,Luke,23027,"And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him."
2996,2819,0,Luke,23028,"But Jesus, turning to them, said, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children."
2997,2820,0,Luke,23029,"For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, &lsquo;Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed!&rsquo;"
2998,2821,0,Luke,23030,"Then they will begin to say to the mountains, &lsquo;Fall on us!&rsquo; and to the hills, &lsquo;Cover us!&rsquo; "
2999,2822,0,Luke,23031,"For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?&rdquo;"
3000,2823,0,Luke,23032,"There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death."
3001,2824,0,Luke,23033,"And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left."
3002,2825,0,Luke,23034,"Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.&rdquo; And they divided His garments and cast lots."
3003,2826,0,Luke,23035,"And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying, &ldquo;He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.&rdquo;"
3004,2827,0,Luke,23036,"The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine,"
3005,2828,0,Luke,23037,"and saying, &ldquo;If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.&rdquo;"
3006,2829,0,Luke,23038,"And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
3007,2830,0,Luke,23039,"Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, &ldquo;If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.&rdquo;"
3008,2831,0,Luke,23040,"But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?"
3009,2832,0,Luke,23041,"And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo;"
3010,2833,0,Luke,23042,"Then he said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.&rdquo;"
3011,2834,0,Luke,23043,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.&rdquo;"
3012,2835,0,Luke,23044,"Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."
3013,2836,0,Luke,23045,"Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two."
3014,2837,0,Luke,23046,"And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, &ldquo;Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.&rdquo; Having said this, He breathed His last."
3015,2838,0,Luke,23047,"So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Certainly this was a righteous Man!&rdquo;"
3016,2839,0,Luke,23048,"And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned."
3017,2840,0,Luke,23049,"But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things."
3018,2841,0,Luke,23050,"Now behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man."
3019,2842,0,Luke,23051,"He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God."
3020,2843,0,Luke,23052,This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
3021,2844,0,Luke,23053,"Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before."
3022,2845,0,Luke,23054,"That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near."
3023,2846,0,Luke,23055,"And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid."
3024,2847,0,Luke,23056,Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
3025,2848,0,Luke,24001,"Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared."
3026,2849,0,Luke,24002,But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
3027,2850,0,Luke,24003,Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
3028,2851,0,Luke,24004,"And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments."
3029,2852,0,Luke,24005,"Then, as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the earth, they said to them, &ldquo;Why do you seek the living among the dead?"
3030,2853,0,Luke,24006,"He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,"
3031,2854,0,Luke,24007,"saying, &lsquo;The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
3032,2855,0,Luke,24008,And they remembered His words.
3033,2856,0,Luke,24009,Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
3034,2857,0,Luke,24010,"It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles."
3035,2858,0,Luke,24011,"And their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them."
3036,2859,0,Luke,24012,"But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened."
3037,2860,0,Luke,24013,"Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem."
3038,2861,0,Luke,24014,And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
3039,2862,0,Luke,24015,"So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them."
3040,2863,0,Luke,24016,"But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not know Him."
3041,2864,0,Luke,24017,"And He said to them, &ldquo;What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?&rdquo; "
3042,2865,0,Luke,24018,"Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You not known the things which happened there in these days?&rdquo;"
3043,2866,0,Luke,24019,"And He said to them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; So they said to Him, &ldquo;The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,"
3044,2867,0,Luke,24020,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him."
3045,2868,0,Luke,24021,"But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened."
3046,2869,0,Luke,24022,"Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us."
3047,2870,0,Luke,24023,"When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive."
3048,2871,0,Luke,24024,"And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.&rdquo;"
3049,2872,0,Luke,24025,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!"
3050,2873,0,Luke,24026,"Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?&rdquo;"
3051,2874,0,Luke,24027,"And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself."
3052,2875,0,Luke,24028,"Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He indicated that He would have gone farther."
3053,2876,0,Luke,24029,"But they constrained Him, saying, &ldquo;Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.&rdquo; And He went in to stay with them."
3054,2877,0,Luke,24030,"Now it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them."
3055,2878,0,Luke,24031,"Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight."
3056,2879,0,Luke,24032,"And they said to one another, &ldquo;Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?&rdquo;"
3057,2880,0,Luke,24033,"So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,"
3058,2881,0,Luke,24034,"saying, &ldquo;The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&rdquo;"
3059,2882,0,Luke,24035,"And they told about the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread."
3060,2883,0,Luke,24036,"Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, &ldquo;Peace to you.&rdquo;"
3061,2884,0,Luke,24037,"But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they had seen a spirit."
3062,2885,0,Luke,24038,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?"
3063,2886,0,Luke,24039,"Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.&rdquo;"
3064,2887,0,Luke,24040,"When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. "
3065,2888,0,Luke,24041,"But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to them, &ldquo;Have you any food here?&rdquo;"
3066,2889,0,Luke,24042,So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. 
3067,2890,0,Luke,24043,And He took it and ate in their presence.
3068,2891,0,Luke,24044,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.&rdquo;"
3069,2892,0,Luke,24045,"And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures."
3070,2893,0,Luke,24046,"Then He said to them, &ldquo;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,"
3071,2894,0,Luke,24047,"and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
3072,2895,0,Luke,24048,And you are witnesses of these things.
3073,2896,0,Luke,24049,"Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.&rdquo;"
3074,2897,0,Luke,24050,"And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them."
3075,2898,0,Luke,24051,"Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven."
3076,2899,0,Luke,24052,"And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,"
3077,2900,0,Luke,24053,and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.
3078,2901,0,John,1001,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
3079,2902,0,John,1002,He was in the beginning with God.
3080,2903,0,John,1003,"All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made."
3081,2904,0,John,1004,"In Him was life, and the life was the light of men."
3082,2905,0,John,1005,"And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it."
3083,2906,0,John,1006,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
3084,2907,0,John,1007,"This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe."
3085,2908,0,John,1008,"He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light."
3086,2909,0,John,1009,That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 
3087,2910,0,John,1010,"He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him."
3088,2911,0,John,1011,"He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him."
3089,2912,0,John,1012,"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:"
3090,2913,0,John,1013,"who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
3091,2914,0,John,1014,"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
3092,2915,0,John,1015,"John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, &ldquo;This was He of whom I said, &lsquo;He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
3093,2916,0,John,1016,"And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace."
3094,2917,0,John,1017,"For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
3095,2918,0,John,1018,"No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."
3096,2919,0,John,1019,"Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;"
3097,2920,0,John,1020,"He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, &ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;"
3098,2921,0,John,1021,"And they asked him, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;"
3099,2922,0,John,1022,"Then they said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;"
3100,2923,0,John,1023,"He said: &ldquo;I am &lsquo;The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the LORD,&rsquo; as the prophet Isaiah said.&rdquo;"
3101,2924,0,John,1024,Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees.
3102,2925,0,John,1025,"And they asked him, saying, &ldquo;Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&rdquo;"
3103,2926,0,John,1026,"John answered them, saying, &ldquo;I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know."
3104,2927,0,John,1027,"It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.&rdquo;"
3105,2928,0,John,1028,"These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
3106,2929,0,John,1029,"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, &ldquo;Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"
3107,2930,0,John,1030,"This is He of whom I said, &lsquo;After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.&rsquo;"
3108,2931,0,John,1031,"I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water.&rdquo;"
3109,2932,0,John,1032,"And John bore witness, saying, &ldquo;I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him."
3110,2933,0,John,1033,"I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, &lsquo;Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;"
3111,2934,0,John,1034,"And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.&rdquo;"
3112,2935,0,John,1035,"Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples."
3113,2936,0,John,1036,"And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God!&rdquo;"
3114,2937,0,John,1037,"The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
3115,2938,0,John,1038,"Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, &ldquo;What do you seek?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; (which is to say, when translated, Teacher) &ldquo;where are You staying?&rdquo;"
3116,2939,0,John,1039,"He said to them, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour)."
3117,2940,0,John,1040,"One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother."
3118,2941,0,John,1041,"He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (which is translated, the Christ)."
3119,2942,0,John,1042,"And he brought him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, &ldquo;You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas&rdquo; (which is translated, A Stone)."
3120,2943,0,John,1043,"The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo;"
3121,2944,0,John,1044,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
3122,2945,0,John,1045,"Philip found Nathanael and said to him, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote &ndash; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&rdquo;"
3123,2946,0,John,1046,"And Nathanael said to him, &ldquo;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; Philip said to him, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;"
3124,2947,0,John,1047,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, &ldquo;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!&rdquo;"
3125,2948,0,John,1048,"Nathanael said to Him, &ldquo;How do You know me?&rdquo; Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&rdquo;"
3126,2949,0,John,1049,"Nathanael answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!&rdquo;"
3127,2950,0,John,1050,"Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Because I said to you, &lsquo;I saw you under the fig tree,&rsquo; do you believe? You will see greater things than these.&rdquo;"
3128,2951,0,John,1051,"And He said to him, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.&rdquo;"
3129,2952,0,John,2001,"On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there."
3130,2953,0,John,2002,Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
3131,2954,0,John,2003,"And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, &ldquo;They have no wine.&rdquo;"
3132,2955,0,John,2004,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.&rdquo;"
3133,2956,0,John,2005,"His mother said to the servants, &ldquo;Whatever He says to you, do it.&rdquo;"
3134,2957,0,John,2006,"Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece."
3135,2958,0,John,2007,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Fill the waterpots with water.&rdquo; And they filled them up to the brim."
3136,2959,0,John,2008,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast.&rdquo; And they took it."
3137,2960,0,John,2009,"When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom."
3138,2961,0,John,2010,"And he said to him, &ldquo;Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!&rdquo;"
3139,2962,0,John,2011,"This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him."
3140,2963,0,John,2012,"After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they did not stay there many days."
3141,2964,0,John,2013,"Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
3142,2965,0,John,2014,"And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business."
3143,2966,0,John,2015,"When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers&rsquo; money and overturned the tables."
3144,2967,0,John,2016,"And He said to those who sold doves, &ldquo;Take these things away! Do not make My Father&rsquo;s house a house of merchandise!&rdquo;"
3145,2968,0,John,2017,"Then His disciples remembered that it was written, &ldquo;Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.&rdquo; "
3146,2969,0,John,2018,"So the Jews answered and said to Him, &ldquo;What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?&rdquo;"
3147,2970,0,John,2019,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;"
3148,2971,0,John,2020,"Then the Jews said, &ldquo;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?&rdquo;"
3149,2972,0,John,2021,But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
3150,2973,0,John,2022,"Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said."
3151,2974,0,John,2023,"Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did."
3152,2975,0,John,2024,"But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men,"
3153,2976,0,John,2025,"and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man."
3154,2977,0,John,3001,"There was a man of the Pharisees named Nikodemos, a ruler of the Jews."
3155,2978,0,John,3002,"This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.&rdquo;"
3156,2979,0,John,3003,"Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
3157,2980,0,John,3004,"Nikodemos said to Him, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born?&rdquo;"
3158,2981,0,John,3005,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
3159,2982,0,John,3006,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
3160,2983,0,John,3007,"Do not marvel that I said to you, &lsquo;You must be born again.&rsquo;"
3161,2984,0,John,3008,"The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo;"
3162,2985,0,John,3009,"Nikodemos answered and said to Him, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo;"
3163,2986,0,John,3010,"Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?"
3164,2987,0,John,3011,"Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness."
3165,2988,0,John,3012,"If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"
3166,2989,0,John,3013,"No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. "
3167,2990,0,John,3014,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,"
3168,2991,0,John,3015,that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.
3169,2992,0,John,3016,"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."
3170,2993,0,John,3017,"For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."
3171,2994,0,John,3018,"He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
3172,2995,0,John,3019,"And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
3173,2996,0,John,3020,"For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed."
3174,2997,0,John,3021,"But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.&rdquo;"
3175,2998,0,John,3022,"After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized."
3176,2999,0,John,3023,"Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized."
3177,3000,0,John,3024,For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
3178,3001,0,John,3025,"Then there arose a dispute between some of John&rsquo;s disciples and the Jews about purification."
3179,3002,0,John,3026,"And they came to John and said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified &ndash; behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!&rdquo;"
3180,3003,0,John,3027,"John answered and said, &ldquo;A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven."
3181,3004,0,John,3028,"You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Christ,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;I have been sent before Him.&rsquo;"
3182,3005,0,John,3029,"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled."
3183,3006,0,John,3030,"He must increase, but I must decrease."
3184,3007,0,John,3031,"He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all."
3185,3008,0,John,3032,"And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony."
3186,3009,0,John,3033,He who has received His testimony has certified that God is true.
3187,3010,0,John,3034,"For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure."
3188,3011,0,John,3035,"The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand."
3189,3012,0,John,3036,"He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.&rdquo;"
3190,3013,0,John,4001,"Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John"
3191,3014,0,John,4002,"(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),"
3192,3015,0,John,4003,He left Judea and departed again to Galilee.
3193,3016,0,John,4004,But He needed to go through Samaria.
3194,3017,0,John,4005,"So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
3195,3018,0,John,4006,"Now Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour."
3196,3019,0,John,4007,"A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Give Me a drink.&rdquo;"
3197,3020,0,John,4008,For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
3198,3021,0,John,4009,"Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans."
3199,3022,0,John,4010,"Jesus answered and said to her, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &lsquo;Give Me a drink,&rsquo; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&rdquo;"
3200,3023,0,John,4011,"The woman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?"
3201,3024,0,John,4012,"Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?&rdquo;"
3202,3025,0,John,4013,"Jesus answered and said to her, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,"
3203,3026,0,John,4014,"but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.&rdquo;"
3204,3027,0,John,4015,"The woman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.&rdquo;"
3205,3028,0,John,4016,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Go, call your husband, and come here.&rdquo;"
3206,3029,0,John,4017,"The woman answered and said, &ldquo;I have no husband.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;You have well said, &lsquo;I have no husband,&rsquo;"
3207,3030,0,John,4018,"for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.&rdquo;"
3208,3031,0,John,4019,"The woman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet."
3209,3032,0,John,4020,"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.&rdquo;"
3210,3033,0,John,4021,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father."
3211,3034,0,John,4022,"You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews."
3212,3035,0,John,4023,"But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him."
3213,3036,0,John,4024,"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&rdquo;"
3214,3037,0,John,4025,"The woman said to Him, &ldquo;I know that Messiah is coming&rdquo; (who is called Christ). &ldquo;When He comes, He will tell us all things.&rdquo;"
3215,3038,0,John,4026,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I who speak to you am He.&rdquo;"
3216,3039,0,John,4027,"And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, &ldquo;What do You seek?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Why are You talking with her?&rdquo;"
3217,3040,0,John,4028,"The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men,"
3218,3041,0,John,4029,"Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?"
3219,3042,0,John,4030,Then they went out of the city and came to Him.
3220,3043,0,John,4031,"In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, eat.&rdquo;"
3221,3044,0,John,4032,"But He said to them, &ldquo;I have food to eat of which you do not know.&rdquo;"
3222,3045,0,John,4033,"Therefore the disciples said to one another, &ldquo;Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?&rdquo;"
3223,3046,0,John,4034,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work."
3224,3047,0,John,4035,"Do you not say, &lsquo;There are still four months and then comes the harvest&rsquo;? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!"
3225,3048,0,John,4036,"And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together."
3226,3049,0,John,4037,"For in this the saying is true: &lsquo;One sows and another reaps.&rsquo;"
3227,3050,0,John,4038,"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.&rdquo;"
3228,3051,0,John,4039,"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, &ldquo;He told me all that I ever did.&rdquo;"
3229,3052,0,John,4040,"So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days."
3230,3053,0,John,4041,And many more believed because of His own word.
3231,3054,0,John,4042,"Then they said to the woman, &ldquo;Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.&rdquo;"
3232,3055,0,John,4043,Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee.
3233,3056,0,John,4044,For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
3234,3057,0,John,4045,"So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast."
3235,3058,0,John,4046,So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
3236,3059,0,John,4047,"When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death."
3237,3060,0,John,4048,"Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.&rdquo;"
3238,3061,0,John,4049,"The nobleman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, come down before my child dies!&rdquo;"
3239,3062,0,John,4050,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go your way; your son lives.&rdquo; So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way."
3240,3063,0,John,4051,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, &ldquo;Your son lives!&rdquo;"
3241,3064,0,John,4052,"Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, &ldquo;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&rdquo;"
3242,3065,0,John,4053,"So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Your son lives.&rdquo; And he himself believed, and his whole household."
3243,3066,0,John,4054,This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
3244,3067,0,John,5001,"After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
3245,3068,0,John,5002,"Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches."
3246,3069,0,John,5003,"In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water."
3247,3070,0,John,5004,"For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. "
3248,3071,0,John,5005,Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.
3249,3072,0,John,5006,"When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, &ldquo;Do you want to be made well?&rdquo;"
3250,3073,0,John,5007,"The sick man answered Him, &ldquo;Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.&rdquo;"
3251,3074,0,John,5008,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Rise, take up your bed and walk.&rdquo;"
3252,3075,0,John,5009,"And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the Sabbath."
3253,3076,0,John,5010,"The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, &ldquo;It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.&rdquo;"
3254,3077,0,John,5011,"He answered them, &ldquo;He who made me well said to me, &lsquo;Take up your bed and walk.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
3255,3078,0,John,5012,"Then they asked him, &ldquo;Who is the Man who said to you, &lsquo;Take up your bed and walk&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
3256,3079,0,John,5013,"But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place."
3257,3080,0,John,5014,"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, &ldquo;See, you have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.&rdquo;"
3258,3081,0,John,5015,The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
3259,3082,0,John,5016,"For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath."
3260,3083,0,John,5017,"But Jesus answered them, &ldquo;My Father has been working until now, and I have been working.&rdquo;"
3261,3084,0,John,5018,"Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God."
3262,3085,0,John,5019,"Then Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner."
3263,3086,0,John,5020,"For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel."
3264,3087,0,John,5021,"For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will."
3265,3088,0,John,5022,"For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,"
3266,3089,0,John,5023,that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
3267,3090,0,John,5024,"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life."
3268,3091,0,John,5025,"Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live."
3269,3092,0,John,5026,"For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,"
3270,3093,0,John,5027,"and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man."
3271,3094,0,John,5028,"Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice"
3272,3095,0,John,5029,"and come forth &ndash; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation."
3273,3096,0,John,5030,"I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me."
3274,3097,0,John,5031,"If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true."
3275,3098,0,John,5032,"There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true."
3276,3099,0,John,5033,"You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth."
3277,3100,0,John,5034,"Yet I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved."
3278,3101,0,John,5035,"He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light."
3279,3102,0,John,5036,"But I have a greater witness than John&rsquo;s; for the works which the Father has given Me to finish &ndash; the very works that I do &ndash; bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me."
3280,3103,0,John,5037,"And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form."
3281,3104,0,John,5038,"But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe."
3282,3105,0,John,5039,"You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me."
3283,3106,0,John,5040,But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
3284,3107,0,John,5041,I do not receive honor from men.
3285,3108,0,John,5042,"But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you."
3286,3109,0,John,5043,"I have come in My Father&rsquo;s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive."
3287,3110,0,John,5044,"How can you believe, who receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?"
3288,3111,0,John,5045,"Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you &ndash; Moses, in whom you trust."
3289,3112,0,John,5046,"For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me."
3290,3113,0,John,5047,"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?&rdquo;"
3291,3114,0,John,6001,"After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias."
3292,3115,0,John,6002,"Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were diseased."
3293,3116,0,John,6003,"And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples."
3294,3117,0,John,6004,"Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near."
3295,3118,0,John,6005,"Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, &ldquo;Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?&rdquo;"
3296,3119,0,John,6006,"But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do."
3297,3120,0,John,6007,"Philip answered Him, &ldquo;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.&rdquo;"
3298,3121,0,John,6008,"One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to Him,"
3299,3122,0,John,6009,"There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?"
3300,3123,0,John,6010,"Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Make the people sit down.&rdquo; Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
3301,3124,0,John,6011,"And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted."
3302,3125,0,John,6012,"So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.&rdquo;"
3303,3126,0,John,6013,"Therefore they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten."
3304,3127,0,John,6014,"Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.&rdquo;"
3305,3128,0,John,6015,"Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone."
3306,3129,0,John,6016,"Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,"
3307,3130,0,John,6017,"got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them."
3308,3131,0,John,6018,Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing.
3309,3132,0,John,6019,"So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid."
3310,3133,0,John,6020,"But He said to them, &ldquo;It is I; do not be afraid.&rdquo;"
3311,3134,0,John,6021,"Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going."
3312,3135,0,John,6022,"On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone &ndash;"
3313,3136,0,John,6023,"however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks &ndash; "
3314,3137,0,John,6024,"when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus."
3315,3138,0,John,6025,"And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did You come here?&rdquo;"
3316,3139,0,John,6026,"Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled."
3317,3140,0,John,6027,"Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.&rdquo;"
3318,3141,0,John,6028,"Then they said to Him, &ldquo;What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?&rdquo;"
3319,3142,0,John,6029,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.&rdquo;"
3320,3143,0,John,6030,"Therefore they said to Him, &ldquo;What sign will You perform then, that we may see it and believe You? What work will You do?"
3321,3144,0,John,6031,"Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, &lsquo;He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&rsquo;&rdquo; "
3322,3145,0,John,6032,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven."
3323,3146,0,John,6033,"For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&rdquo;"
3324,3147,0,John,6034,"Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, give us this bread always.&rdquo;"
3325,3148,0,John,6035,"And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst."
3326,3149,0,John,6036,But I said to you that you have seen Me and yet do not believe.
3327,3150,0,John,6037,"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out."
3328,3151,0,John,6038,"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."
3329,3152,0,John,6039,"This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day."
3330,3153,0,John,6040,"And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.&rdquo;"
3331,3154,0,John,6041,"The Jews then complained about Him, because He said, &ldquo;I am the bread which came down from heaven.&rdquo;"
3332,3155,0,John,6042,"And they said, &ldquo;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He says, &lsquo;I have come down from heaven&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
3333,3156,0,John,6043,"Jesus therefore answered and said to them, &ldquo;Do not murmur among yourselves."
3334,3157,0,John,6044,"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day."
3335,3158,0,John,6045,"It is written in the prophets, &lsquo;And they shall all be taught by God.&rsquo; Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me."
3336,3159,0,John,6046,"Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father."
3337,3160,0,John,6047,"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life."
3338,3161,0,John,6048,I am the bread of life.
3339,3162,0,John,6049,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead."
3340,3163,0,John,6050,"This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die."
3341,3164,0,John,6051,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.&rdquo;"
3342,3165,0,John,6052,"The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves, saying, &ldquo;How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo;"
3343,3166,0,John,6053,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you."
3344,3167,0,John,6054,"Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."
3345,3168,0,John,6055,"For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed."
3346,3169,0,John,6056,"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him."
3347,3170,0,John,6057,"As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me."
3348,3171,0,John,6058,"This is the bread which came down from heaven &ndash; not as your fathers ate the manna, and are dead. He who eats this bread will live forever.&rdquo;"
3349,3172,0,John,6059,These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
3350,3173,0,John,6060,"Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, &ldquo;This is a hard saying; who can understand it?&rdquo;"
3351,3174,0,John,6061,"When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about this, He said to them, &ldquo;Does this offend you?"
3352,3175,0,John,6062,What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before?
3353,3176,0,John,6063,"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life."
3354,3177,0,John,6064,"But there are some of you who do not believe.&rdquo; For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray Him."
3355,3178,0,John,6065,"And He said, &ldquo;Therefore I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father.&rdquo;"
3356,3179,0,John,6066,From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.
3357,3180,0,John,6067,"Then Jesus said to the twelve, &ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo;"
3358,3181,0,John,6068,"But Simon Peter answered Him, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
3359,3182,0,John,6069,"Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; "
3360,3183,0,John,6070,"Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?&rdquo;"
3361,3184,0,John,6071,"He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who would betray Him, being one of the twelve."
3362,3185,0,John,7001,"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him."
3363,3186,0,John,7002,"Now the Jews&rsquo; Feast of Tabernacles was at hand."
3364,3187,0,John,7003,"His brothers therefore said to Him, &ldquo;Depart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing."
3365,3188,0,John,7004,"For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.&rdquo;"
3366,3189,0,John,7005,For even His brothers did not believe in Him.
3367,3190,0,John,7006,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready."
3368,3191,0,John,7007,"The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it that its works are evil."
3369,3192,0,John,7008,"You go up to this feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for My time has not yet fully come.&rdquo;"
3370,3193,0,John,7009,"When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee."
3371,3194,0,John,7010,"But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."
3372,3195,0,John,7011,"Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo;"
3373,3196,0,John,7012,"And there was much complaining among the people concerning Him. Some said, &ldquo;He is good&rdquo;; others said, &ldquo;No, on the contrary, He deceives the people.&rdquo;"
3374,3197,0,John,7013,"However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews."
3375,3198,0,John,7014,Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
3376,3199,0,John,7015,"And the Jews marveled, saying, &ldquo;How does this Man know letters, having never studied?&rdquo;"
3377,3200,0,John,7016,"Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me."
3378,3201,0,John,7017,"If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority."
3379,3202,0,John,7018,"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him."
3380,3203,0,John,7019,"Did not Moses give you the law, yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill Me?&rdquo;"
3381,3204,0,John,7020,"The people answered and said, &ldquo;You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?&rdquo;"
3382,3205,0,John,7021,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;I did one work, and you all marvel."
3383,3206,0,John,7022,"Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath."
3384,3207,0,John,7023,"If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?"
3385,3208,0,John,7024,"Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.&rdquo;"
3386,3209,0,John,7025,"Now some of them from Jerusalem said, &ldquo;Is this not He whom they seek to kill?"
3387,3210,0,John,7026,"But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is truly the Christ?"
3388,3211,0,John,7027,"However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.&rdquo;"
3389,3212,0,John,7028,"Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, &ldquo;You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know."
3390,3213,0,John,7029,"But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me.&rdquo;"
3391,3214,0,John,7030,"Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come."
3392,3215,0,John,7031,"And many of the people believed in Him, and said, &ldquo;When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?&rdquo;"
3393,3216,0,John,7032,"The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him."
3394,3217,0,John,7033,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to Him who sent Me."
3395,3218,0,John,7034,"You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you cannot come.&rdquo;"
3396,3219,0,John,7035,"Then the Jews said among themselves, &ldquo;Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?"
3397,3220,0,John,7036,"What is this thing that He said, &lsquo;You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
3398,3221,0,John,7037,"On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink."
3399,3222,0,John,7038,"He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;"
3400,3223,0,John,7039,"But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
3401,3224,0,John,7040,"Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, &ldquo;Truly this is the Prophet.&rdquo;"
3402,3225,0,John,7041,"Others said, &ldquo;This is the Christ.&rdquo; But some said, &ldquo;Will the Christ come out of Galilee?"
3403,3226,0,John,7042,"Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?&rdquo;"
3404,3227,0,John,7043,So there was a division among the people because of Him.
3405,3228,0,John,7044,"Now some of them wanted to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him."
3406,3229,0,John,7045,"Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, &ldquo;Why have you not brought Him?&rdquo;"
3407,3230,0,John,7046,"The officers answered, &ldquo;No man ever spoke like this Man!&rdquo;"
3408,3231,0,John,7047,"Then the Pharisees answered them, &ldquo;Are you also deceived?"
3409,3232,0,John,7048,Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him?
3410,3233,0,John,7049,"But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.&rdquo;"
3411,3234,0,John,7050,"Nikodemos (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them,"
3412,3235,0,John,7051,"&ldquo;Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?&rdquo;"
3413,3236,0,John,7052,"They answered and said to him, &ldquo;Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.&rdquo;"
3414,3237,0,John,7053,And everyone went to his own house. 
3415,3238,0,John,8001,But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
3416,3239,0,John,8002,"Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them."
3417,3240,0,John,8003,"Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,"
3418,3241,0,John,8004,"they said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act."
3419,3242,0,John,8005,"Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?&rdquo;"
3420,3243,0,John,8006,"This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear. "
3421,3244,0,John,8007,"So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&rdquo;"
3422,3245,0,John,8008,And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
3423,3246,0,John,8009,"Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."
3424,3247,0,John,8010,"When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, &ldquo;Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo;"
3425,3248,0,John,8011,"She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; And Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.&rdquo;"
3426,3249,0,John,8012,"Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.&rdquo;"
3427,3250,0,John,8013,"The Pharisees therefore said to Him, &ldquo;You bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true.&rdquo;"
3428,3251,0,John,8014,"Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going."
3429,3252,0,John,8015,"You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one."
3430,3253,0,John,8016,"And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent Me."
3431,3254,0,John,8017,It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.
3432,3255,0,John,8018,"I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.&rdquo;"
3433,3256,0,John,8019,"Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Where is Your Father?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.&rdquo;"
3434,3257,0,John,8020,"These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come."
3435,3258,0,John,8021,"Then Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.&rdquo;"
3436,3259,0,John,8022,"So the Jews said, &ldquo;Will He kill Himself, because He says, &lsquo;Where I go you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
3437,3260,0,John,8023,"And He said to them, &ldquo;You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world."
3438,3261,0,John,8024,"Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.&rdquo;"
3439,3262,0,John,8025,"Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning."
3440,3263,0,John,8026,"I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.&rdquo;"
3441,3264,0,John,8027,They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.
3442,3265,0,John,8028,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things."
3443,3266,0,John,8029,"And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.&rdquo;"
3444,3267,0,John,8030,"As He spoke these words, many believed in Him."
3445,3268,0,John,8031,"Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, &ldquo;If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed."
3446,3269,0,John,8032,"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&rdquo;"
3447,3270,0,John,8033,"They answered Him, &ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say, &lsquo;You will be made free&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
3448,3271,0,John,8034,"Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin."
3449,3272,0,John,8035,"And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever."
3450,3273,0,John,8036,"Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed."
3451,3274,0,John,8037,"I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you."
3452,3275,0,John,8038,"I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.&rdquo;"
3453,3276,0,John,8039,"They answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you were Abraham&rsquo;s children, you would do the works of Abraham."
3454,3277,0,John,8040,"But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this."
3455,3278,0,John,8041,"You do the deeds of your father.&rdquo; Then they said to Him, &ldquo;We were not born of fornication; we have one Father &ndash; God.&rdquo;"
3456,3279,0,John,8042,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me."
3457,3280,0,John,8043,Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word.
3458,3281,0,John,8044,"You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
3459,3282,0,John,8045,"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me."
3460,3283,0,John,8046,"Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?"
3461,3284,0,John,8047,"He who is of God hears God&rsquo;s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.&rdquo;"
3462,3285,0,John,8048,"Then the Jews answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?&rdquo;"
3463,3286,0,John,8049,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me."
3464,3287,0,John,8050,"And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges."
3465,3288,0,John,8051,"Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death.&rdquo;"
3466,3289,0,John,8052,"Then the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;Now we know that You have a demon! Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and You say, &lsquo;If anyone keeps My word he shall never taste death.&rsquo;"
3467,3290,0,John,8053,"Are You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Who do You make Yourself out to be?&rdquo;"
3468,3291,0,John,8054,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who honors Me, of whom you say that He is your God."
3469,3292,0,John,8055,"Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, &lsquo;I do not know Him,&rsquo; I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word."
3470,3293,0,John,8056,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&rdquo;"
3471,3294,0,John,8057,"Then the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&rdquo;"
3472,3295,0,John,8058,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.&rdquo;"
3473,3296,0,John,8059,"Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
3474,3297,0,John,9001,"Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth."
3475,3298,0,John,9002,"And His disciples asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&rdquo;"
3476,3299,0,John,9003,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him."
3477,3300,0,John,9004,"I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work."
3478,3301,0,John,9005,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo;"
3479,3302,0,John,9006,"When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay."
3480,3303,0,John,9007,"And He said to him, &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&rdquo; (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing."
3481,3304,0,John,9008,"Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was blind said, &ldquo;Is not this he who sat and begged?&rdquo;"
3482,3305,0,John,9009,"Some said, &ldquo;This is he.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;He is like him.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am he.&rdquo;"
3483,3306,0,John,9010,"Therefore they said to him, &ldquo;How were your eyes opened?&rdquo;"
3484,3307,0,John,9011,"He answered and said, &ldquo;A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, &lsquo;Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.&rsquo; So I went and washed, and I received sight.&rdquo;"
3485,3308,0,John,9012,"Then they said to him, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;"
3486,3309,0,John,9013,They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees.
3487,3310,0,John,9014,Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
3488,3311,0,John,9015,"Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, &ldquo;He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&rdquo;"
3489,3312,0,John,9016,"Therefore some of the Pharisees said, &ldquo;This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&rdquo; And there was a division among them."
3490,3313,0,John,9017,"They said to the blind man again, &ldquo;What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;He is a prophet.&rdquo;"
3491,3314,0,John,9018,"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight."
3492,3315,0,John,9019,"And they asked them, saying, &ldquo;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&rdquo;"
3493,3316,0,John,9020,"His parents answered them and said, &ldquo;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;"
3494,3317,0,John,9021,"but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.&rdquo;"
3495,3318,0,John,9022,"His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that He was Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue."
3496,3319,0,John,9023,"Therefore his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age; ask him.&rdquo;"
3497,3320,0,John,9024,"So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, &ldquo;Give God the glory! We know that this Man is a sinner.&rdquo;"
3498,3321,0,John,9025,"He answered and said, &ldquo;Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;"
3499,3322,0,John,9026,"Then they said to him again, &ldquo;What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?&rdquo;"
3500,3323,0,John,9027,"He answered them, &ldquo;I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?&rdquo;"
3501,3324,0,John,9028,"Then they reviled him and said, &ldquo;You are His disciple, but we are Moses&rsquo; disciples."
3502,3325,0,John,9029,"We know that God spoke to Moses; as for this fellow, we do not know where He is from.&rdquo;"
3503,3326,0,John,9030,"The man answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes!"
3504,3327,0,John,9031,"Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him."
3505,3328,0,John,9032,Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind.
3506,3329,0,John,9033,"If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.&rdquo;"
3507,3330,0,John,9034,"They answered and said to him, &ldquo;You were completely born in sins, and are you teaching us?&rdquo; And they cast him out."
3508,3331,0,John,9035,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of God?&rdquo; "
3509,3332,0,John,9036,"He answered and said, &ldquo;Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?&rdquo;"
3510,3333,0,John,9037,"And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.&rdquo;"
3511,3334,0,John,9038,"Then he said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe!&rdquo; And he worshiped Him."
3512,3335,0,John,9039,"And Jesus said, &ldquo;For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may be made blind.&rdquo;"
3513,3336,0,John,9040,"Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, &ldquo;Are we blind also?&rdquo;"
3514,3337,0,John,9041,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, &lsquo;We see.&rsquo; Therefore your sin remains."
3515,3338,0,John,10001,"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
3516,3339,0,John,10002,But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
3517,3340,0,John,10003,"To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out."
3518,3341,0,John,10004,"And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice."
3519,3342,0,John,10005,"Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.&rdquo;"
3520,3343,0,John,10006,"Jesus used this illustration, but they did not understand the things which He spoke to them."
3521,3344,0,John,10007,"Then Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
3522,3345,0,John,10008,"All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them."
3523,3346,0,John,10009,"I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture."
3524,3347,0,John,10010,"The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."
3525,3348,0,John,10011,I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.
3526,3349,0,John,10012,"But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them."
3527,3350,0,John,10013,The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.
3528,3351,0,John,10014,"I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own."
3529,3352,0,John,10015,"As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep."
3530,3353,0,John,10016,"And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd."
3531,3354,0,John,10017,"Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again."
3532,3355,0,John,10018,"No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.&rdquo;"
3533,3356,0,John,10019,Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings.
3534,3357,0,John,10020,"And many of them said, &ldquo;He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?&rdquo;"
3535,3358,0,John,10021,"Others said, &ldquo;These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&rdquo;"
3536,3359,0,John,10022,"Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter."
3537,3360,0,John,10023,"And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon&rsquo;s porch."
3538,3361,0,John,10024,"Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, &ldquo;How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.&rdquo;"
3539,3362,0,John,10025,"Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father&rsquo;s name, they bear witness of Me."
3540,3363,0,John,10026,"But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. "
3541,3364,0,John,10027,"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me."
3542,3365,0,John,10028,"And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand."
3543,3366,0,John,10029,"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand."
3544,3367,0,John,10030,"I and My Father are one.&rdquo;"
3545,3368,0,John,10031,Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
3546,3369,0,John,10032,"Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?&rdquo;"
3547,3370,0,John,10033,"The Jews answered Him, saying, &ldquo;For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.&rdquo;"
3548,3371,0,John,10034,"Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Is it not written in your law, &lsquo;I said, &ldquo;You are gods&rdquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;? "
3549,3372,0,John,10035,"If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),"
3550,3373,0,John,10036,"do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, &lsquo;You are blaspheming,&rsquo; because I said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God&rsquo;?"
3551,3374,0,John,10037,"If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;"
3552,3375,0,John,10038,"but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.&rdquo;"
3553,3376,0,John,10039,"Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand."
3554,3377,0,John,10040,"And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there He stayed."
3555,3378,0,John,10041,"Then many came to Him and said, &ldquo;John performed no sign, but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true.&rdquo;"
3556,3379,0,John,10042,And many believed in Him there.
3557,3380,0,John,11001,"Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha."
3558,3381,0,John,11002,"It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick."
3559,3382,0,John,11003,"Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&rdquo;"
3560,3383,0,John,11004,"When Jesus heard that, He said, &ldquo;This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&rdquo;"
3561,3384,0,John,11005,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
3562,3385,0,John,11006,"So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was."
3563,3386,0,John,11007,"Then after this He said to the disciples, &ldquo;Let us go to Judea again.&rdquo;"
3564,3387,0,John,11008,"The disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to stone You, and are You going there again?&rdquo;"
3565,3388,0,John,11009,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
3566,3389,0,John,11010,"But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&rdquo;"
3567,3390,0,John,11011,"These things He said, and after that He said to them, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.&rdquo;"
3568,3391,0,John,11012,"Then His disciples said, &ldquo;Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.&rdquo;"
3569,3392,0,John,11013,"However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep."
3570,3393,0,John,11014,"Then Jesus said to them plainly, &ldquo;Lazarus is dead."
3571,3394,0,John,11015,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.&rdquo;"
3572,3395,0,John,11016,"Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &ldquo;Let us also go, that we may die with Him.&rdquo;"
3573,3396,0,John,11017,"So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days."
3574,3397,0,John,11018,"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away."
3575,3398,0,John,11019,"And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother."
3576,3399,0,John,11020,"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house."
3577,3400,0,John,11021,"Now Martha said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo;"
3578,3401,0,John,11022,"But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."
3579,3402,0,John,11023,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Your brother will rise again.&rdquo;"
3580,3403,0,John,11024,"Martha said to Him, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&rdquo;"
3581,3404,0,John,11025,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live."
3582,3405,0,John,11026,"And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?&rdquo;"
3583,3406,0,John,11027,"She said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.&rdquo;"
3584,3407,0,John,11028,"And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, &ldquo;The Teacher has come and is calling for you.&rdquo;"
3585,3408,0,John,11029,"As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him."
3586,3409,0,John,11030,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him."
3587,3410,0,John,11031,"Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, &ldquo;She is going to the tomb to weep there.&rdquo; "
3588,3411,0,John,11032,"Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo;"
3589,3412,0,John,11033,"Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled."
3590,3413,0,John,11034,"And He said, &ldquo;Where have you laid him?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, come and see.&rdquo;"
3591,3414,0,John,11035,Jesus wept.
3592,3415,0,John,11036,"Then the Jews said, &ldquo;See how He loved him!&rdquo;"
3593,3416,0,John,11037,"And some of them said, &ldquo;Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?&rdquo;"
3594,3417,0,John,11038,"Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it."
3595,3418,0,John,11039,"Jesus said, &ldquo;Take away the stone.&rdquo; Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.&rdquo;"
3596,3419,0,John,11040,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?&rdquo;"
3597,3420,0,John,11041,"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me."
3598,3421,0,John,11042,"And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.&rdquo;"
3599,3422,0,John,11043,"Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth!&rdquo;"
3600,3423,0,John,11044,"And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Loose him, and let him go.&rdquo;"
3601,3424,0,John,11045,"Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him."
3602,3425,0,John,11046,But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did.
3603,3426,0,John,11047,"Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, &ldquo;What shall we do? For this Man works many signs."
3604,3427,0,John,11048,"If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.&rdquo;"
3605,3428,0,John,11049,"And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &ldquo;You know nothing at all,"
3606,3429,0,John,11050,"nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.&rdquo;"
3607,3430,0,John,11051,"Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,"
3608,3431,0,John,11052,"and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad."
3609,3432,0,John,11053,"Then, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death."
3610,3433,0,John,11054,"Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there remained with His disciples."
3611,3434,0,John,11055,"And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves."
3612,3435,0,John,11056,"Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, &ldquo;What do you think &ndash; that He will not come to the feast?&rdquo;"
3613,3436,0,John,11057,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might seize Him."
3614,3437,0,John,12001,"Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead."
3615,3438,0,John,12002,"There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him."
3616,3439,0,John,12003,"Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil."
3617,3440,0,John,12004,"But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, who would betray Him, said,"
3618,3441,0,John,12005,Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
3619,3442,0,John,12006,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it."
3620,3443,0,John,12007,"But Jesus said, &ldquo;Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial."
3621,3444,0,John,12008,"For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.&rdquo;"
3622,3445,0,John,12009,"Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus&rsquo; sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead."
3623,3446,0,John,12010,"But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also,"
3624,3447,0,John,12011,because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
3625,3448,0,John,12012,"The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
3626,3449,0,John,12013,"took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out: &ldquo;Hosanna! &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!&rsquo; The King of Israel!&rdquo;"
3627,3450,0,John,12014,"Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:"
3628,3451,0,John,12015,"&ldquo;Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkey&rsquo;s colt.&rdquo; "
3629,3452,0,John,12016,"His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him."
3630,3453,0,John,12017,"Therefore the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness."
3631,3454,0,John,12018,"For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign."
3632,3455,0,John,12019,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, &ldquo;You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him!&rdquo;"
3633,3456,0,John,12020,Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast.
3634,3457,0,John,12021,"Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&rdquo;"
3635,3458,0,John,12022,"Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus."
3636,3459,0,John,12023,"But Jesus answered them, saying, &ldquo;The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified."
3637,3460,0,John,12024,"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain."
3638,3461,0,John,12025,"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life."
3639,3462,0,John,12026,"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor."
3640,3463,0,John,12027,"Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? &lsquo;Father, save Me from this hour&rsquo;? But for this purpose I came to this hour."
3641,3464,0,John,12028,"Father, glorify Your name.&rdquo; Then a voice came from heaven, saying, &ldquo;I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.&rdquo;"
3642,3465,0,John,12029,"Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, &ldquo;An angel has spoken to Him.&rdquo;"
3643,3466,0,John,12030,"Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake."
3644,3467,0,John,12031,"Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out."
3645,3468,0,John,12032,"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.&rdquo;"
3646,3469,0,John,12033,"This He said, signifying by what death He would die."
3647,3470,0,John,12034,"The people answered Him, &ldquo;We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, &lsquo;The Son of Man must be lifted up&rsquo;? Who is this Son of Man?&rdquo;"
3648,3471,0,John,12035,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going."
3649,3472,0,John,12036,"While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.&rdquo; These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them."
3650,3473,0,John,12037,"But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him,"
3651,3474,0,John,12038,"that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: &ldquo;Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?&rdquo; "
3652,3475,0,John,12039,"Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:"
3653,3476,0,John,12040,"&ldquo;He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, so that I should heal them.&rdquo; "
3654,3477,0,John,12041,These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.
3655,3478,0,John,12042,"Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;"
3656,3479,0,John,12043,for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
3657,3480,0,John,12044,"Then Jesus cried out and said, &ldquo;He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me."
3658,3481,0,John,12045,And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.
3659,3482,0,John,12046,"I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness."
3660,3483,0,John,12047,"And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world."
3661,3484,0,John,12048,"He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him &ndash; the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day."
3662,3485,0,John,12049,"For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak."
3663,3486,0,John,12050,"And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak.&rdquo;"
3664,3487,0,John,13001,"Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end."
3665,3488,0,John,13002,"And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, to betray Him,"
3666,3489,0,John,13003,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,"
3667,3490,0,John,13004,"rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself."
3668,3491,0,John,13005,"After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded."
3669,3492,0,John,13006,"Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, are You washing my feet?&rdquo;"
3670,3493,0,John,13007,"Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.&rdquo;"
3671,3494,0,John,13008,"Peter said to Him, &ldquo;You shall never wash my feet!&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.&rdquo;"
3672,3495,0,John,13009,"Simon Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!&rdquo;"
3673,3496,0,John,13010,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.&rdquo;"
3674,3497,0,John,13011,"For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, &ldquo;You are not all clean.&rdquo;"
3675,3498,0,John,13012,"So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, &ldquo;Do you know what I have done to you?"
3676,3499,0,John,13013,"You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am."
3677,3500,0,John,13014,"If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet."
3678,3501,0,John,13015,"For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you."
3679,3502,0,John,13016,"Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him."
3680,3503,0,John,13017,"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."
3681,3504,0,John,13018,"I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, &lsquo;He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.&rsquo; "
3682,3505,0,John,13019,"Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I am He."
3683,3506,0,John,13020,"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.&rdquo;"
3684,3507,0,John,13021,"When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.&rdquo;"
3685,3508,0,John,13022,"Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke."
3686,3509,0,John,13023,"Now there was leaning on Jesus&rsquo; bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved."
3687,3510,0,John,13024,Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.
3688,3511,0,John,13025,"Then, leaning back on Jesus&rsquo; breast, he said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;"
3689,3512,0,John,13026,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.&rdquo; And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."
3690,3513,0,John,13027,"Now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;What you do, do quickly.&rdquo;"
3691,3514,0,John,13028,But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him.
3692,3515,0,John,13029,"For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, &ldquo;Buy those things we need for the feast,&rdquo; or that he should give something to the poor."
3693,3516,0,John,13030,"Having received the piece of bread, he then went out immediately. And it was night."
3694,3517,0,John,13031,"So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him."
3695,3518,0,John,13032,"If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him immediately."
3696,3519,0,John,13033,"Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come,&rsquo; so now I say to you."
3697,3520,0,John,13034,"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another."
3698,3521,0,John,13035,"By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo;"
3699,3522,0,John,13036,"Simon Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, where are You going?&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Where I am going you cannot follow Me now, but you shall follow Me afterward.&rdquo;"
3700,3523,0,John,13037,"Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.&rdquo;"
3701,3524,0,John,13038,"Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Will you lay down your life for My sake? Most assuredly, I say to you, the rooster shall not crow till you have denied Me three times."
3702,3525,0,John,14001,"Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me."
3703,3526,0,John,14002,"In My Father&rsquo;s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. "
3704,3527,0,John,14003,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also."
3705,3528,0,John,14004,"And where I go you know, and the way you know.&rdquo;"
3706,3529,0,John,14005,"Thomas said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?&rdquo;"
3707,3530,0,John,14006,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."
3708,3531,0,John,14007,"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.&rdquo;"
3709,3532,0,John,14008,"Philip said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.&rdquo;"
3710,3533,0,John,14009,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, &lsquo;Show us the Father&rsquo;?"
3711,3534,0,John,14010,"Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works."
3712,3535,0,John,14011,"Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves."
3713,3536,0,John,14012,"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father."
3714,3537,0,John,14013,"And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
3715,3538,0,John,14014,"If you ask anything in My name, I will do it."
3716,3539,0,John,14015,"If you love Me, keep My commandments."
3717,3540,0,John,14016,"And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever &ndash; "
3718,3541,0,John,14017,"the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you."
3719,3542,0,John,14018,"I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you."
3720,3543,0,John,14019,"A little while longer and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also."
3721,3544,0,John,14020,"At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
3722,3545,0,John,14021,"He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.&rdquo;"
3723,3546,0,John,14022,"Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?&rdquo;"
3724,3547,0,John,14023,"Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him."
3725,3548,0,John,14024,"He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father&rsquo;s who sent Me."
3726,3549,0,John,14025,These things I have spoken to you while being present with you.
3727,3550,0,John,14026,"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you."
3728,3551,0,John,14027,"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
3729,3552,0,John,14028,"You have heard Me say to you, &lsquo;I am going away and coming back to you.&rsquo; If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, &lsquo;I am going to the Father,&rsquo; for My Father is greater than I."
3730,3553,0,John,14029,"And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe."
3731,3554,0,John,14030,"I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me."
3732,3555,0,John,14031,"But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go from here."
3733,3556,0,John,15001,"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser."
3734,3557,0,John,15002,"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit."
3735,3558,0,John,15003,You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
3736,3559,0,John,15004,"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me."
3737,3560,0,John,15005,"I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing."
3738,3561,0,John,15006,"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned."
3739,3562,0,John,15007,"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you."
3740,3563,0,John,15008,"By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples."
3741,3564,0,John,15009,"As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love."
3742,3565,0,John,15010,"If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father&rsquo;s commandments and abide in His love."
3743,3566,0,John,15011,"These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full."
3744,3567,0,John,15012,"This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."
3745,3568,0,John,15013,"Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one&rsquo;s life for his friends."
3746,3569,0,John,15014,You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.
3747,3570,0,John,15015,"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you."
3748,3571,0,John,15016,"You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you."
3749,3572,0,John,15017,"These things I command you, that you love one another."
3750,3573,0,John,15018,"If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you."
3751,3574,0,John,15019,"If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
3752,3575,0,John,15020,"Remember the word that I said to you, &lsquo;A servant is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also."
3753,3576,0,John,15021,"But all these things they will do to you for My name&rsquo;s sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me."
3754,3577,0,John,15022,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin."
3755,3578,0,John,15023,He who hates Me hates My Father also.
3756,3579,0,John,15024,"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father."
3757,3580,0,John,15025,"But this happened that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, &lsquo;They hated Me without a cause.&rsquo; "
3758,3581,0,John,15026,"But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me."
3759,3582,0,John,15027,"And you also will bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning."
3760,3583,0,John,16001,"These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be made to stumble."
3761,3584,0,John,16002,"They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service."
3762,3585,0,John,16003,And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.
3763,3586,0,John,16004,"But these things I have told you, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you."
3764,3587,0,John,16005,"But now I go away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, &lsquo;Where are You going?&rsquo;"
3765,3588,0,John,16006,"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart."
3766,3589,0,John,16007,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you."
3767,3590,0,John,16008,"And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:"
3768,3591,0,John,16009,"of sin, because they do not believe in Me;"
3769,3592,0,John,16010,"of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;"
3770,3593,0,John,16011,"of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged."
3771,3594,0,John,16012,"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now."
3772,3595,0,John,16013,"However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come."
3773,3596,0,John,16014,"He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you."
3774,3597,0,John,16015,All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you. 
3775,3598,0,John,16016,"A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.&rdquo;"
3776,3599,0,John,16017,"Then some of His disciples said among themselves, &ldquo;What is this that He says to us, &lsquo;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;because I go to the Father&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
3777,3600,0,John,16018,"They said therefore, &ldquo;What is this that He says, &lsquo;A little while&rsquo;? We do not know what He is saying.&rdquo;"
3778,3601,0,John,16019,"Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, &ldquo;Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, &lsquo;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&rsquo;?"
3779,3602,0,John,16020,"Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy."
3780,3603,0,John,16021,"A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world."
3781,3604,0,John,16022,"Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you."
3782,3605,0,John,16023,"And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you."
3783,3606,0,John,16024,"Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full."
3784,3607,0,John,16025,"These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will tell you plainly about the Father."
3785,3608,0,John,16026,"In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;"
3786,3609,0,John,16027,"for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God."
3787,3610,0,John,16028,"I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.&rdquo; "
3788,3611,0,John,16029,"His disciples said to Him, &ldquo;See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech!"
3789,3612,0,John,16030,"Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.&rdquo;"
3790,3613,0,John,16031,"Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Do you now believe?"
3791,3614,0,John,16032,"Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me."
3792,3615,0,John,16033,"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.&rdquo;"
3793,3616,0,John,17001,"Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: &ldquo;Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,"

3796,3619,0,John,17004,I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.
3797,3620,0,John,17005,"And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was."
3798,3621,0,John,17006,"I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word."
3799,3622,0,John,17007,Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You.
3800,3623,0,John,17008,"For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me."
3801,3624,0,John,17009,"I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours."
3802,3625,0,John,17010,"And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them."
3803,3626,0,John,17011,"Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are."
3804,3627,0,John,17012,"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled."
3805,3628,0,John,17013,"But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves."
3806,3629,0,John,17014,"I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world."
3807,3630,0,John,17015,"I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one."
3808,3631,0,John,17016,"They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world."
3809,3632,0,John,17017,Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.
3810,3633,0,John,17018,"As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world."
3811,3634,0,John,17019,"And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth."
3812,3635,0,John,17020,"I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word;"
3813,3636,0,John,17021,"that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me."
3814,3637,0,John,17022,"And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:"
3815,3638,0,John,17023,"I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me."
3816,3639,0,John,17024,"Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world."
3817,3640,0,John,17025,"O righteous Father! The world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me."
3818,3641,0,John,17026,"And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.&rdquo;"
3819,3642,0,John,18001,"When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples over the Brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered."
3820,3643,0,John,18002,"And Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with His disciples."
3821,3644,0,John,18003,"Then Judas, having received a detachment of troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons."
3822,3645,0,John,18004,"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, &ldquo;Whom are you seeking?&rdquo;"
3823,3646,0,John,18005,"They answered Him, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I am He.&rdquo; And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them."
3824,3647,0,John,18006,"Now when He said to them, &ldquo;I am He,&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground."
3825,3648,0,John,18007,"Then He asked them again, &ldquo;Whom are you seeking?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;"
3826,3649,0,John,18008,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;I have told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way,&rdquo;"
3827,3650,0,John,18009,"that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, &ldquo;Of those whom You gave Me I have lost none.&rdquo;"
3828,3651,0,John,18010,"Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&rsquo;s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant&rsquo;s name was Malchus."
3829,3652,0,John,18011,"So Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?&rdquo;"
3830,3653,0,John,18012,Then the detachment of troops and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him.
3831,3654,0,John,18013,"And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year."
3832,3655,0,John,18014,Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
3833,3656,0,John,18015,"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest."
3834,3657,0,John,18016,"But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in."
3835,3658,0,John,18017,"Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, &ldquo;You are not also one of this Man&rsquo;s disciples, are you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;"
3836,3659,0,John,18018,"Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself."
3837,3660,0,John,18019,The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.
3838,3661,0,John,18020,"Jesus answered him, &ldquo;I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing."
3839,3662,0,John,18021,"Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Indeed they know what I said.&rdquo;"
3840,3663,0,John,18022,"And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, &ldquo;Do You answer the high priest like that?&rdquo;"
3841,3664,0,John,18023,"Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?&rdquo;"
3842,3665,0,John,18024,Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
3843,3666,0,John,18025,"Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, &ldquo;You are not also one of His disciples, are you?&rdquo; He denied it and said, &ldquo;I am not!&rdquo;"
3844,3667,0,John,18026,"One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, &ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with Him?&rdquo;"
3845,3668,0,John,18027,"Peter then denied again; and immediately a rooster crowed."
3846,3669,0,John,18028,"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they themselves did not go into the Praetorium, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover."
3847,3670,0,John,18029,"Pilate then went out to them and said, &ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this Man?&rdquo;"
3848,3671,0,John,18030,"They answered and said to him, &ldquo;If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.&rdquo;"
3849,3672,0,John,18031,"Then Pilate said to them, &ldquo;You take Him and judge Him according to your law.&rdquo; Therefore the Jews said to him, &ldquo;It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,&rdquo;"
3850,3673,0,John,18032,"that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would die."
3851,3674,0,John,18033,"Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo;"
3852,3675,0,John,18034,"Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this concerning Me?&rdquo;"
3853,3676,0,John,18035,"Pilate answered, &ldquo;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?&rdquo;"
3854,3677,0,John,18036,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.&rdquo;"
3855,3678,0,John,18037,"Pilate therefore said to Him, &ldquo;Are You a king then?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.&rdquo;"
3856,3679,0,John,18038,"Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, &ldquo;I find no fault in Him at all."
3857,3680,0,John,18039,"But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;"
3858,3681,0,John,18040,"Then they all cried again, saying, &ldquo;Not this Man, but Barabbas!&rdquo; Now Barabbas was a robber."
3859,3682,0,John,19001,So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.
3860,3683,0,John,19002,"And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe."
3861,3684,0,John,19003,"Then they said, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo; And they struck Him with their hands."
3862,3685,0,John,19004,"Pilate then went out again, and said to them, &ldquo;Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.&rdquo;"
3863,3686,0,John,19005,"Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Behold the Man!&rdquo;"
3864,3687,0,John,19006,"Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, &ldquo;Crucify Him, crucify Him!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.&rdquo;"
3865,3688,0,John,19007,"The Jews answered him, &ldquo;We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.&rdquo;"
3866,3689,0,John,19008,"Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid,"
3867,3690,0,John,19009,"and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Where are You from?&rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer."
3868,3691,0,John,19010,"Then Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?&rdquo;"
3869,3692,0,John,19011,"Jesus answered, &ldquo;You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.&rdquo;"
3870,3693,0,John,19012,"From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, &ldquo;If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar&rsquo;s friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.&rdquo;"
3871,3694,0,John,19013,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
3872,5076,0,Rom,11011,"I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But through their fall, to provoke them to jealousy, salvation has come to the Gentiles."
3873,5077,0,Rom,11012,"Now if their fall is riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!"
3874,5078,0,Rom,11013,"For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,"
3875,5079,0,Rom,11014,if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them.
3876,5080,0,Rom,11015,"For if their being cast away is the reconciling of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?"
3877,5081,0,Rom,11016,"For if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches."
3878,5082,0,Rom,11017,"And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree,"
3879,5083,0,Rom,11018,"do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you."
3880,5084,0,Rom,11019,"You will say then, &ldquo;Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.&rdquo;"
3881,5085,0,Rom,11020,"Well said. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear."
3882,5086,0,Rom,11021,"For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either."
3883,5087,0,Rom,11022,"Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off."
3884,5088,0,Rom,11023,"And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again."
3885,5089,0,Rom,11024,"For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?"
3886,5090,0,Rom,11025,"For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in."
3887,5091,0,Rom,11026,"And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: &ldquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;"
3888,5092,0,Rom,11027,"for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.&rdquo; "
3889,5093,0,Rom,11028,"Concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but concerning the election they are beloved for the sake of the fathers."
3890,5094,0,Rom,11029,For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
3891,5095,0,Rom,11030,"For as you were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience,"
3892,5096,0,Rom,11031,"even so these also have now been disobedient, that through the mercy shown you they also may obtain mercy."
3893,5097,0,Rom,11032,"For God has committed them all to disobedience, that He might have mercy on all."
3894,5098,0,Rom,11033,"Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!"
3895,5099,0,Rom,11034,"&ldquo;For who has known the mind of the LORD? Or who has become His counselor?&rdquo; "
3896,5100,0,Rom,11035,"&ldquo;Or who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?&rdquo; "
3897,5101,0,Rom,11036,"For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen."
3898,5102,0,Rom,12001,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service."
3899,5103,0,Rom,12002,"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."
3900,5104,0,Rom,12003,"For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith."
3901,5105,0,Rom,12004,"For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,"
3902,5106,0,Rom,12005,"so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another."
3903,5107,0,Rom,12006,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith;"
3904,5108,0,Rom,12007,"or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching;"
3905,5109,0,Rom,12008,"he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness."
3906,5110,0,Rom,12009,Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good.
3907,5111,0,Rom,12010,"Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another;"
3908,5112,0,Rom,12011,"not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;"
3909,5113,0,Rom,12012,"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer;"
3910,5114,0,Rom,12013,"distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality."
3911,5115,0,Rom,12014,"Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse."
3912,5116,0,Rom,12015,"Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep."
3913,5117,0,Rom,12016,"Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion."
3914,5118,0,Rom,12017,Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men.
3915,5119,0,Rom,12018,"If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men."
3916,5120,0,Rom,12019,"Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, &ldquo;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,&rdquo; says the Lord."
3917,5121,0,Rom,12020,"Therefore &ldquo;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.&rdquo; "
3918,5122,0,Rom,12021,"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
3919,5123,0,Rom,13001,"Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God."
3920,5124,0,Rom,13002,"Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves."
3921,5125,0,Rom,13003,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same."
3922,5126,0,Rom,13004,"For he is God&rsquo;s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God&rsquo;s minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil."
3923,5127,0,Rom,13005,"Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience&rsquo; sake."
3924,5128,0,Rom,13006,"For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God&rsquo;s ministers attending continually to this very thing."
3925,5129,0,Rom,13007,"Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor."
3926,5130,0,Rom,13008,"Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law."
3927,5131,0,Rom,13009,"For the commandments, &ldquo;You shall not commit adultery,&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not murder,&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not steal,&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not bear false witness,&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not covet,&rdquo; and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;"
3928,5132,0,Rom,13010,"Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law."
3929,5133,0,Rom,13011,"And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed."
3930,5134,0,Rom,13012,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light."
3931,5135,0,Rom,13013,"Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy."
3932,5136,0,Rom,13014,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts."
3933,5137,0,Rom,14001,"Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things."
3934,5138,0,Rom,14002,"For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables."
3935,5139,0,Rom,14003,"Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him."
3936,5140,0,Rom,14004,"Who are you to judge another&rsquo;s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand."
3937,5141,0,Rom,14005,"One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind."
3938,5142,0,Rom,14006,"He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks."
3939,5143,0,Rom,14007,"For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself."
3940,5144,0,Rom,14008,"For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s."
3941,5145,0,Rom,14009,"For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living."
3942,5146,0,Rom,14010,But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 
3943,5147,0,Rom,14011,"For it is written: &ldquo;As I live, says the LORD, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.&rdquo; "
3944,5148,0,Rom,14012,So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.
3945,5149,0,Rom,14013,"Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother&rsquo;s way."
3946,5150,0,Rom,14014,"I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
3947,5151,0,Rom,14015,"Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died."
3948,5152,0,Rom,14016,"Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;"
3949,5153,0,Rom,14017,"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
3950,5154,0,Rom,14018,For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.
3951,5155,0,Rom,14019,Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.
3952,5156,0,Rom,14020,"Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man who eats with offense."
3953,5157,0,Rom,14021,It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak. 
3954,5158,0,Rom,14022,Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
3955,5159,0,Rom,14023,"But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin. "
3956,5160,0,Rom,15001,"We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
3957,5161,0,Rom,15002,"Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, leading to edification."
3958,5162,0,Rom,15003,"For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, &ldquo;The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.&rdquo; "
3959,5163,0,Rom,15004,"For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope."
3960,5164,0,Rom,15005,"Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus,"
3961,5165,0,Rom,15006,that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
3962,5329,0,1Cor,6006,"But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers!"
3963,5330,0,1Cor,6007,"Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather let yourselves be cheated?"
3964,5331,0,1Cor,6008,"No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you do these things to your brethren!"
3965,5332,0,1Cor,6009,"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,"
3966,5333,0,1Cor,6010,"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."
3967,5334,0,1Cor,6011,"And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
3968,5335,0,1Cor,6012,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
3969,5336,0,1Cor,6013,"Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body."
3970,5337,0,1Cor,6014,And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.
3971,5338,0,1Cor,6015,Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Certainly not!
3972,5339,0,1Cor,6016,"Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? For &ldquo;the two,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;shall become one flesh.&rdquo;"
3973,5340,0,1Cor,6017,But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
3974,5341,0,1Cor,6018,"Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body."
3975,5342,0,1Cor,6019,"Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?"
3976,5343,0,1Cor,6020,"For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God&rsquo;s."
3977,5344,0,1Cor,7001,Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
3978,5345,0,1Cor,7002,"Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband."
3979,5346,0,1Cor,7003,"Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband."
3980,5347,0,1Cor,7004,"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."
3981,5348,0,1Cor,7005,"Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
3982,5349,0,1Cor,7006,"But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment."
3983,5350,0,1Cor,7007,"For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that."
3984,5351,0,1Cor,7008,"But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;"
3985,5352,0,1Cor,7009,"but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
3986,5353,0,1Cor,7010,"Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her husband."
3987,5354,0,1Cor,7011,"But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife."
3988,5355,0,1Cor,7012,"But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her."
3989,5356,0,1Cor,7013,"And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him."
3990,5357,0,1Cor,7014,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy."
3991,5358,0,1Cor,7015,"But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us to peace."
3992,5359,0,1Cor,7016,"For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?"
3993,5360,0,1Cor,7017,"But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches."
3994,5361,0,1Cor,7018,Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
3995,5362,0,1Cor,7019,"Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters."
3996,5363,0,1Cor,7020,Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.
3997,5364,0,1Cor,7021,"Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather use it."
3998,5365,0,1Cor,7022,"For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord&rsquo;s freedman. Likewise he who is called while free is Christ&rsquo;s slave."
3999,5366,0,1Cor,7023,"You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men."
4000,5367,0,1Cor,7024,"Brethren, let each one remain with God in that state in which he was called."
4001,5368,0,1Cor,7025,"Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one whom the Lord in His mercy has made trustworthy."
4002,5369,0,1Cor,7026,"I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress &ndash; that it is good for a man to remain as he is:"
4003,5370,0,1Cor,7027,Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
4004,5371,0,1Cor,7028,"But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I would spare you."
4005,5372,0,1Cor,7029,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none,"
4006,5373,0,1Cor,7030,"those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,"
4007,5374,0,1Cor,7031,and those who use this world as not misusing it. For the form of this world is passing away.
4008,5375,0,1Cor,7032,"But I want you to be without care. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord &ndash; how he may please the Lord."
4009,5376,0,1Cor,7033,"But he who is married cares about the things of the world &ndash; how he may please his wife."
4010,5377,0,1Cor,7034,"There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world &ndash; how she may please her husband."
4011,5378,0,1Cor,7035,"And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction."
4012,5379,0,1Cor,7036,"But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry."
4013,5380,0,1Cor,7037,"Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well."
4014,5381,0,1Cor,7038,"So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better."
4015,5382,0,1Cor,7039,"A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord."
4016,5383,0,1Cor,7040,"But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my judgment &ndash; and I think I also have the Spirit of God."
4017,5384,0,1Cor,8001,"Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies."
4018,5385,0,1Cor,8002,"And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know."
4019,5386,0,1Cor,8003,"But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him."
4020,5387,0,1Cor,8004,"Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one."
4021,5388,0,1Cor,8005,"For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),"
4022,5389,0,1Cor,8006,"yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live."
4023,5390,0,1Cor,8007,"However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."
4024,5391,0,1Cor,8008,"But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse."
4025,5392,0,1Cor,8009,But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
4026,5393,0,1Cor,8010,"For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol&rsquo;s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols?"
4027,5394,0,1Cor,8011,"And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
4028,5395,0,1Cor,8012,"But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ."
4029,5396,0,1Cor,8013,"Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble."
4030,5397,0,1Cor,9001,Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
4031,5398,0,1Cor,9002,"If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
4032,5399,0,1Cor,9003,My defense to those who examine me is this:
4033,5400,0,1Cor,9004,Do we have no right to eat and drink?
4034,5401,0,1Cor,9005,"Do we have no right to take along a believing wife, as do also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"
4035,5402,0,1Cor,9006,Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working?
4036,5403,0,1Cor,9007,Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock?
4037,5404,0,1Cor,9008,Do I say these things as a mere man? Or does not the law say the same also?
4038,5405,0,1Cor,9009,"For it is written in the law of Moses, &ldquo;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.&rdquo; Is it oxen God is concerned about?"
4039,5406,0,1Cor,9010,"Or does He say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope."
4040,6380,0,Col,3008,"But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth."
4041,6381,0,Col,3009,"Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds,"
4042,6382,0,Col,3010,"and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,"
4043,6383,0,Col,3011,"where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all."
4044,6384,0,Col,3012,"Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;"
4045,6385,0,Col,3013,"bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do."
4046,6386,0,Col,3014,"But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection."
4047,6387,0,Col,3015,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful."
4048,6388,0,Col,3016,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
4049,6389,0,Col,3017,"And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
4050,6390,0,Col,3018,"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
4051,6391,0,Col,3019,"Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them."
4052,6392,0,Col,3020,"Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord."
4053,6393,0,Col,3021,"Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged."
4054,6394,0,Col,3022,"Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God."
4055,6395,0,Col,3023,"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men,"
4056,6396,0,Col,3024,"knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ."
4057,6397,0,Col,3025,"But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality."
4058,6398,0,Col,4001,"Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
4059,6399,0,Col,4002,"Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;"
4060,6400,0,Col,4003,"meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains,"
4061,6401,0,Col,4004,"that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
4062,6402,0,Col,4005,"Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time."
4063,6403,0,Col,4006,"Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one."
4064,6404,0,Col,4007,"Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me."
4065,6405,0,Col,4008,"I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,"
4066,6406,0,Col,4009,"with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are happening here."
4067,6407,0,Col,4010,"Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),"
4068,6408,0,Col,4011,"and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me."
4069,6409,0,Col,4012,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
4070,6410,0,Col,4013,"For I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis."
4071,6411,0,Col,4014,Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you.
4072,6412,0,Col,4015,"Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in his house."
4073,6413,0,Col,4016,"Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
4074,6414,0,Col,4017,"And say to Archippus, &ldquo;Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.&rdquo;"
4075,6415,0,Col,4018,"This salutation by my own hand &ndash; Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen."
4076,6416,0,1Thess,1001,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
4077,6417,0,1Thess,1002,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,"
4078,6418,0,1Thess,1003,"remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,"
4079,6419,0,1Thess,1004,"knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God."
4080,6420,0,1Thess,1005,"For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake."
4081,6421,0,1Thess,1006,"And you became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,"
4082,6422,0,1Thess,1007,so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.
4083,6423,0,1Thess,1008,"For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything."
4084,6424,0,1Thess,1009,"For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,"
4085,6425,0,1Thess,1010,"and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come."
4086,6426,0,1Thess,2001,"For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain."
4087,6427,0,1Thess,2002,"But even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict."
4088,6428,0,1Thess,2003,"For our exhortation did not come from error or uncleanness, nor was it in deceit."
4089,6429,0,1Thess,2004,"But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts."
4090,6430,0,1Thess,2005,"For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak for covetousness &ndash; God is witness."
4091,6431,0,1Thess,2006,"Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, when we might have made demands as apostles of Christ."
4092,6432,0,1Thess,2007,"But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children."
4093,6433,0,1Thess,2008,"So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us."
4094,6434,0,1Thess,2009,"For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God."
4095,6435,0,1Thess,2010,"You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe;"
4096,6436,0,1Thess,2011,"as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children,"
4097,6437,0,1Thess,2012,that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
4098,6438,0,1Thess,2013,"For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe."
4099,6439,0,1Thess,2014,"For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans,"
4100,6440,0,1Thess,2015,"who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men,"
4101,6441,0,1Thess,2016,"forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost."
4102,6442,0,1Thess,2017,"But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly to see your face with great desire."
4103,6443,0,1Thess,2018,"Therefore we wanted to come to you &ndash; even I, Paul, time and again &ndash; but Satan hindered us."
4104,6444,0,1Thess,2019,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?"
4105,6445,0,1Thess,2020,For you are our glory and joy.
4106,6446,0,1Thess,3001,"Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone,"
4107,6447,0,1Thess,3002,"and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith,"
4108,6448,0,1Thess,3003,"that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this."
4109,6449,0,1Thess,3004,"For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation, just as it happened, and you know."
4110,6450,0,1Thess,3005,"For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent him to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor might be in vain."
4111,6451,0,1Thess,3006,"But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also to see you &ndash; "
4112,6452,0,1Thess,3007,"therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were comforted concerning you by your faith."
4113,6453,0,1Thess,3008,"For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord."
4114,6454,0,1Thess,3009,"For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God,"
4115,6455,0,1Thess,3010,night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and perfect what is lacking in your faith?
4116,6456,0,1Thess,3011,"Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you."
4117,6457,0,1Thess,3012,"And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we do to you,"
4118,6871,0,Heb,4001,"Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it."
4119,6872,0,Heb,4002,"For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it."
4120,6873,0,Heb,4003,"For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: &ldquo;So I swore in My wrath, &lsquo;They shall not enter My rest,&rsquo;&rdquo; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
4121,6874,0,Heb,4004,"For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: &ldquo;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&rdquo;;"
4122,6875,0,Heb,4005,"and again in this place: &ldquo;They shall not enter My rest.&rdquo;"
4123,6876,0,Heb,4006,"Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience,"
4124,6877,0,Heb,4007,"again He designates a certain day, saying in David, &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; after such a long time, as it has been said: &ldquo;Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&rdquo;"
4125,6878,0,Heb,4008,"For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day."
4126,6879,0,Heb,4009,There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.
4127,6880,0,Heb,4010,For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.
4128,6881,0,Heb,4011,"Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience."
4129,6882,0,Heb,4012,"For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
4130,6883,0,Heb,4013,"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account."
4131,6884,0,Heb,4014,"Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
4132,6885,0,Heb,4015,"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin."
4133,6886,0,Heb,4016,"Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
4134,6887,0,Heb,5001,"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins."
4135,6888,0,Heb,5002,"He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness."
4136,6889,0,Heb,5003,"Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins."
4137,6890,0,Heb,5004,"And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was."
4138,6891,0,Heb,5005,"So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: &ldquo;You are My Son, today I have begotten You.&rdquo;"
4139,6892,0,Heb,5006,"As He also says in another place: &ldquo;You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek&rdquo;;"
4140,6893,0,Heb,5007,"who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear,"
4141,6894,0,Heb,5008,"though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered."
4142,6895,0,Heb,5009,"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,"
4143,6896,0,Heb,5010,"called by God as High Priest &ldquo;according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;"
4144,6897,0,Heb,5011,"We have much to say about Melchizedek, which is hard to explain, since you have become dull in hearing."
4145,6898,0,Heb,5012,"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food."
4146,6899,0,Heb,5013,"For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe."
4147,6900,0,Heb,5014,"But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
4148,6901,0,Heb,6001,"Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,"
4149,6902,0,Heb,6002,"of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
4150,6903,0,Heb,6003,And this we will do if God permits.
4151,6904,0,Heb,6004,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,"
4152,6905,0,Heb,6005,"and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,"
4153,6906,0,Heb,6006,"if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame."
4154,6907,0,Heb,6007,"For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God;"
4155,6908,0,Heb,6008,"but if it bears thorns and briers, it is rejected and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned."
4156,6909,0,Heb,6009,"But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, yes, things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this manner."
4157,6910,0,Heb,6010,"For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
4158,6911,0,Heb,6011,"And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end,"
4159,6912,0,Heb,6012,"that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
4160,6913,0,Heb,6013,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,"
4161,6914,0,Heb,6014,"saying, &ldquo;Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.&rdquo;"
4162,6915,0,Heb,6015,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
4163,6916,0,Heb,6016,"For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute."
4164,6917,0,Heb,6017,"Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath,"
4165,6918,0,Heb,6018,"that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us."
4166,6919,0,Heb,6019,"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil,"
4167,6920,0,Heb,6020,"where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
4168,6921,0,Heb,7001,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,"
4169,6922,0,Heb,7002,"to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated &ldquo;king of righteousness,&rdquo; and then also king of Salem, meaning &ldquo;king of peace,&rdquo;"
4170,6923,0,Heb,7003,"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually."
4171,6924,0,Heb,7004,"Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils."
4172,6925,0,Heb,7005,"And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;"
4173,6926,0,Heb,7006,but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
4174,6927,0,Heb,7007,Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.
4175,6928,0,Heb,7008,"Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives."
4176,6929,0,Heb,7009,"Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,"
4177,6930,0,Heb,7010,for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
4178,6931,0,Heb,7011,"Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron"
4179,6932,0,Heb,7012,"For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law."
4180,6933,0,Heb,7013,"For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has officiated at the altar."
4181,6934,0,Heb,7014,"For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood."
4182,6935,0,Heb,7015,"And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest"
4183,6936,0,Heb,7016,"who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life."
4184,6937,0,Heb,7017,"For He testifies: &ldquo;You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;"
4185,6938,0,Heb,7018,"For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness,"
4186,6939,0,Heb,7019,"for the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, there is the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God."
4187,6940,0,Heb,7020,And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath
4188,6941,0,Heb,7021,"(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him: &ldquo;The LORD has sworn and will not relent, &lsquo;You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek&rsquo;&rdquo;),"
4189,6942,0,Heb,7022,by so much more Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant.
4190,6943,0,Heb,7023,"Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing."
4191,6944,0,Heb,7024,"But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood."
4192,6945,0,Heb,7025,"Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."
4193,6946,0,Heb,7026,"For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;"
4194,6947,0,Heb,7027,"who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for the people&rsquo;s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself."
4195,6948,0,Heb,7028,"For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son who has been perfected forever."
4196,6949,0,Heb,8001,"Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,"
4197,6950,0,Heb,8002,"a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man."
4198,6951,0,Heb,8003,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer.
4199,6952,0,Heb,8004,"For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;"
4200,6953,0,Heb,8005,"who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, &ldquo;See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.&rdquo;"
4201,6954,0,Heb,8006,"But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises."
4202,6955,0,Heb,8007,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second."
4203,6956,0,Heb,8008,"Because finding fault with them, He says: &ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah &ndash; "
4204,6957,0,Heb,8009,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the LORD."
4205,6958,0,Heb,8010,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
4206,3968,0,Acts,6011,"Then they secretly induced men to say, &ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&rdquo;"
4207,3969,0,Acts,6012,"And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him, seized him, and brought him to the council."
4208,3970,0,Acts,6013,"They also set up false witnesses who said, &ldquo;This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law;"
4209,3971,0,Acts,6014,"for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.&rdquo;"
4210,3972,0,Acts,6015,"And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel."
4211,3973,0,Acts,7001,"Then the high priest said, &ldquo;Are these things so?&rdquo;"
4212,3974,0,Acts,7002,"And he said, &ldquo;Brethren and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,"
4213,3975,0,Acts,7003,"and said to him, &lsquo;Get out of your country and from your relatives, and come to a land that I will show you.&rsquo; "
4214,3976,0,Acts,7004,"Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell."
4215,3977,0,Acts,7005,"And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even enough to set his foot on. But even when Abraham had no child, He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him."
4216,3978,0,Acts,7006,"But God spoke in this way: that his descendants would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage and oppress them four hundred years."
4217,3979,0,Acts,7007,"&lsquo;And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge,&rsquo; said God, &lsquo;and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.&rsquo; "
4218,3980,0,Acts,7008,"Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs."
4219,3981,0,Acts,7009,"And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him"
4220,3982,0,Acts,7010,"and delivered him out of all his troubles, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
4221,3983,0,Acts,7011,"Now a famine and great trouble came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no sustenance."
4222,3984,0,Acts,7012,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."
4223,3985,0,Acts,7013,"And the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph&rsquo;s family became known to the Pharaoh."
4224,3986,0,Acts,7014,"Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him, seventy-five people."
4225,3987,0,Acts,7015,"So Jacob went down to Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers."
4226,3988,0,Acts,7016,"And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem."
4227,3989,0,Acts,7017,"But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt"

4269,4031,0,Acts,7059,"And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&rdquo;"
4270,4032,0,Acts,7060,"Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lord, do not charge them with this sin.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
4271,4033,0,Acts,8001,"Now Saul was consenting to his death. At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles."
4272,4034,0,Acts,8002,"And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him."
4273,4035,0,Acts,8003,"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison."
4274,4036,0,Acts,8004,Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word.
4275,4037,0,Acts,8005,Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.
4276,4038,0,Acts,8006,"And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did."
4277,4039,0,Acts,8007,"For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed."
4278,4040,0,Acts,8008,And there was great joy in that city.
4279,4041,0,Acts,8009,"But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously practiced sorcery in the city and astonished the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great,"
4280,4042,0,Acts,8010,"to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, &ldquo;This man is the great power of God.&rdquo;"
4281,4043,0,Acts,8011,And they heeded him because he had astonished them with his sorceries for a long time.
4282,4044,0,Acts,8012,"But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized."
4283,4045,0,Acts,8013,"Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which were done."
4284,4046,0,Acts,8014,"Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,"
4285,4047,0,Acts,8015,"who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit."
4286,4048,0,Acts,8016,For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
4287,4049,0,Acts,8017,"Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
4288,4050,0,Acts,8018,"And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles&rsquo; hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,"
4289,4051,0,Acts,8019,"saying, &ldquo;Give me this power also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;"
4290,4052,0,Acts,8020,"But Peter said to him, &ldquo;Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!"
4291,4053,0,Acts,8021,"You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God."
4292,4054,0,Acts,8022,"Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you."
4293,4055,0,Acts,8023,"For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity.&rdquo;"
4294,4056,0,Acts,8024,"Then Simon answered and said, &ldquo;Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.&rdquo;"
4295,4057,0,Acts,8025,"So when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."
4296,4058,0,Acts,8026,"Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, &ldquo;Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.&rdquo; This is desert."
4297,4059,0,Acts,8027,"So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,"
4298,4060,0,Acts,8028,"was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet."
4299,4061,0,Acts,8029,"Then the Spirit said to Philip, &ldquo;Go near and overtake this chariot.&rdquo;"
4300,5484,0,1Cor,11029,"For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord&rsquo;s body."
4301,5485,0,1Cor,11030,"For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep."
4302,5486,0,1Cor,11031,"For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged."
4303,5487,0,1Cor,11032,"But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
4304,5488,0,1Cor,11033,"Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
4305,5489,0,1Cor,11034,"But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come."
4306,5490,0,1Cor,12001,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant:"
4307,5491,0,1Cor,12002,"You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led."
4308,5492,0,1Cor,12003,"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit."
4309,5493,0,1Cor,12004,"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
4310,5494,0,1Cor,12005,"There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord."
4311,5495,0,1Cor,12006,"And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all."
4312,5496,0,1Cor,12007,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all:
4313,5497,0,1Cor,12008,"for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit,"
4314,5498,0,1Cor,12009,"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,"
4315,5499,0,1Cor,12010,"to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues."
4316,5500,0,1Cor,12011,"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills."
4317,5501,0,1Cor,12012,"For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ."
4318,5502,0,1Cor,12013,"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body &ndash; whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free &ndash; and have all been made to drink into one Spirit."
4319,5503,0,1Cor,12014,For in fact the body is not one member but many.
4320,5504,0,1Cor,12015,"If the foot should say, &ldquo;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,&rdquo; is it therefore not of the body?"
4321,5505,0,1Cor,12016,"And if the ear should say, &ldquo;Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,&rdquo; is it therefore not of the body?"
4322,5506,0,1Cor,12017,"If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?"
4323,5507,0,1Cor,12018,"But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased."
4324,5508,0,1Cor,12019,"And if they were all one member, where would the body be?"
4325,5509,0,1Cor,12020,"But now indeed there are many members, yet one body."
4326,5510,0,1Cor,12021,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, &ldquo;I have no need of you&rdquo;; nor again the head to the feet, &ldquo;I have no need of you.&rdquo;"
4327,5511,0,1Cor,12022,"No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary."
4328,5512,0,1Cor,12023,"And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty,"
4329,5513,0,1Cor,12024,"but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it,"
4330,5514,0,1Cor,12025,"that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another."
4331,5515,0,1Cor,12026,"And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
4332,5516,0,1Cor,12027,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually."
4333,5517,0,1Cor,12028,"And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues."
4334,5518,0,1Cor,12029,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
4335,5519,0,1Cor,12030,Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
4336,5520,0,1Cor,12031,But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.
4337,5521,0,1Cor,13001,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal."
4338,5522,0,1Cor,13002,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing."
4339,5523,0,1Cor,13003,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing."
4340,5524,0,1Cor,13004,"Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;"
4341,5525,0,1Cor,13005,"does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;"
4342,5526,0,1Cor,13006,"does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;"
4343,5527,0,1Cor,13007,"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
4344,5528,0,1Cor,13008,"Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away."
4345,5529,0,1Cor,13009,For we know in part and we prophesy in part.
4346,5530,0,1Cor,13010,"But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away."
4347,5531,0,1Cor,13011,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
4348,5532,0,1Cor,13012,"For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known."
4349,5533,0,1Cor,13013,"And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
4350,5534,0,1Cor,14001,"Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."
4351,5535,0,1Cor,14002,"For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries."
4352,5536,0,1Cor,14003,But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to men.
4353,5537,0,1Cor,14004,"He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church."
4354,5538,0,1Cor,14005,"I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification."
4355,5539,0,1Cor,14006,"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?"
4356,5540,0,1Cor,14007,"Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or played?"
4357,5541,0,1Cor,14008,"For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle?"
4358,5542,0,1Cor,14009,"So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air."
4359,5629,0,1Cor,15056,"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law."
4360,5630,0,1Cor,15057,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
4361,5631,0,1Cor,15058,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
4362,5632,0,1Cor,16001,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also:"
4363,5633,0,1Cor,16002,"On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come."
4364,5634,0,1Cor,16003,"And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters I will send to bear your gift to Jerusalem."
4365,5635,0,1Cor,16004,"But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me."
4366,5636,0,1Cor,16005,Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia).
4367,5637,0,1Cor,16006,"And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me on my journey, wherever I go."
4368,5638,0,1Cor,16007,"For I do not wish to see you now on the way; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits."
4369,5639,0,1Cor,16008,But I will tarry in Ephesus until Pentecost.
4370,5640,0,1Cor,16009,"For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
4371,5641,0,1Cor,16010,"And if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do."
4372,5642,0,1Cor,16011,"Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren."
4373,5643,0,1Cor,16012,"Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but he was quite unwilling to come at this time; however, he will come when he has a convenient time."
4374,5644,0,1Cor,16013,"Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong."
4375,5645,0,1Cor,16014,Let all that you do be done with love.
4376,5646,0,1Cor,16015,"I urge you, brethren &ndash; you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints &ndash; "
4377,5647,0,1Cor,16016,"that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us."
4378,6048,0,Gal,6005,For each one shall bear his own load.
4379,6049,0,Gal,6006,Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.
4380,6050,0,Gal,6007,"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap."
4381,6051,0,Gal,6008,"For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life."
4382,6052,0,Gal,6009,"And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart."
4383,6053,0,Gal,6010,"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith."
4384,6054,0,Gal,6011,See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!
4385,6055,0,Gal,6012,"As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
4386,6056,0,Gal,6013,"For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh."
4387,6057,0,Gal,6014,"But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
4388,6058,0,Gal,6015,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation."
4389,6059,0,Gal,6016,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God."
4390,6060,0,Gal,6017,"From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
4391,6061,0,Gal,6018,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
4392,6062,0,Eph,1001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:"
4393,6063,0,Eph,1002,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4394,6064,0,Eph,1003,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,"
4395,6065,0,Eph,1004,"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,"
4396,6066,0,Eph,1005,"having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,"
4397,6067,0,Eph,1006,"to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved."
4398,6068,0,Eph,1007,"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace"
4399,6069,0,Eph,1008,"which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,"
4400,6070,0,Eph,1009,"having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,"
4401,6071,0,Eph,1010,"that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth &ndash; in Him."
4402,6072,0,Eph,1011,"In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will,"
4403,6073,0,Eph,1012,that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.
4404,6074,0,Eph,1013,"In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,"
4405,6075,0,Eph,1014,"who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory."
4406,6076,0,Eph,1015,"Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,"
4407,6077,0,Eph,1016,"do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers:"
4408,6078,0,Eph,1017,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,"
4409,6079,0,Eph,1018,"the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,"
4410,6080,0,Eph,1019,"and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power"
4411,6081,0,Eph,1020,"which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,"
4412,6082,0,Eph,1021,"far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come."
4413,6083,0,Eph,1022,"And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church,"
4414,6084,0,Eph,1023,"which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."
4415,6085,0,Eph,2001,"And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,"
4416,6086,0,Eph,2002,"in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,"
4417,6087,0,Eph,2003,"among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others."
4418,6088,0,Eph,2004,"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,"
4419,6089,0,Eph,2005,"even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),"
4420,6090,0,Eph,2006,"and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,"
4421,6091,0,Eph,2007,that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
4422,6092,0,Eph,2008,"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,"
4423,6093,0,Eph,2009,"not of works, lest anyone should boast."
4424,6094,0,Eph,2010,"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
4425,6095,0,Eph,2011,"Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh &ndash; who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands &ndash; "
4426,6096,0,Eph,2012,"that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
4427,6097,0,Eph,2013,But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
4428,6098,0,Eph,2014,"For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation,"
4429,6099,0,Eph,2015,"having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace,"
4430,6100,0,Eph,2016,"and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity."
4431,6101,0,Eph,2017,And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near.
4432,6102,0,Eph,2018,For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
4433,6103,0,Eph,2019,"Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,"
4434,6104,0,Eph,2020,"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone,"
4435,6105,0,Eph,2021,"in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,"
4436,6106,0,Eph,2022,in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
4437,6107,0,Eph,3001,"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles &ndash; "
4438,6108,0,Eph,3002,"if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,"
4439,6109,0,Eph,3003,"how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already,"
4440,6110,0,Eph,3004,"by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ),"
4441,6111,0,Eph,3005,"which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:"
4442,6112,0,Eph,3006,"that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,"
4443,6113,0,Eph,3007,of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power.
4444,6114,0,Eph,3008,"To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,"
4445,6115,0,Eph,3009,"and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ;"
4446,6116,0,Eph,3010,"to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places,"
4447,6117,0,Eph,3011,"according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,"
4448,6118,0,Eph,3012,in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him.
4449,6119,0,Eph,3013,"Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
4450,6120,0,Eph,3014,"For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
4451,6121,0,Eph,3015,"from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
4452,6122,0,Eph,3016,"that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man,"
4453,6123,0,Eph,3017,"that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
4454,6124,0,Eph,3018,"may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height &ndash; "
4455,6125,0,Eph,3019,"to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
4456,6126,0,Eph,3020,"Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"
4457,6127,0,Eph,3021,"to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen."
4458,6128,0,Eph,4001,"I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,"
4459,6129,0,Eph,4002,"with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,"
4460,6130,0,Eph,4003,endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
4461,6131,0,Eph,4004,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling;"
4462,6132,0,Eph,4005,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism;"
4463,3695,0,John,19014,"Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, &ldquo;Behold your King!&rdquo;"
4464,3696,0,John,19015,"But they cried out, &ldquo;Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&rdquo; The chief priests answered, &ldquo;We have no king but Caesar!&rdquo;"
4465,3697,0,John,19016,Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led Him away. 
4466,3698,0,John,19017,"And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,"
4467,3699,0,John,19018,"where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center."
4468,3700,0,John,19019,"Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
4469,3701,0,John,19020,"Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin."
4470,3702,0,John,19021,"Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &ldquo;Do not write, &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;He said, &ldquo;I am the King of the Jews.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
4471,3703,0,John,19022,"Pilate answered, &ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;"
4472,3704,0,John,19023,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece."
4473,3705,0,John,19024,"They said therefore among themselves, &ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,&rdquo; that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.&rdquo; Therefore the soldiers did this."
4474,3706,0,John,19025,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
4475,3707,0,John,19026,"When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, &ldquo;Woman, behold your son!&rdquo;"
4476,3708,0,John,19027,"Then He said to the disciple, &ldquo;Behold your mother!&rdquo; And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home."
4477,3709,0,John,19028,"After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, &ldquo;I thirst!&rdquo;"
4478,3710,0,John,19029,"Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth."
4479,3711,0,John,19030,"So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit."
4480,3712,0,John,19031,"Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
4481,3713,0,John,19032,Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him.
4482,3714,0,John,19033,"But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs."
4483,3715,0,John,19034,"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out."
4484,3716,0,John,19035,"And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe."
4485,3717,0,John,19036,"For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, &ldquo;Not one of His bones shall be broken.&rdquo; "
4486,3718,0,John,19037,"And again another Scripture says, &ldquo;They shall look on Him whom they pierced.&rdquo; "
4487,3719,0,John,19038,"After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus."
4488,3720,0,John,19039,"And Nikodemos, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds."
4489,3721,0,John,19040,"Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury."
4490,3722,0,John,19041,"Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid."
4491,3723,0,John,19042,"So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews&rsquo; Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby."
4492,3724,0,John,20001,"Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb."
4493,3725,0,John,20002,"Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.&rdquo;"
4494,3726,0,John,20003,"Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb."
4495,3727,0,John,20004,"So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first."
4496,3728,0,John,20005,"And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in."
4497,3729,0,John,20006,"Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,"
4498,3730,0,John,20007,"and the handkerchief that had been around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together in a place by itself."
4499,3731,0,John,20008,"Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed."
4500,3732,0,John,20009,"For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead."
4501,3733,0,John,20010,Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.
4502,3734,0,John,20011,"But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the tomb."
4503,3735,0,John,20012,"And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
4504,3736,0,John,20013,"Then they said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.&rdquo;"
4505,3737,0,John,20014,"Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus."
4506,3738,0,John,20015,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&rdquo; She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.&rdquo;"
4507,3739,0,John,20016,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and said to Him, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (which is to say, Teacher)."
4508,3740,0,John,20017,"Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, &lsquo;I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
4509,3741,0,John,20018,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her."
4510,3742,0,John,20019,"Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo;"
4511,3743,0,John,20020,"When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord."
4512,3744,0,John,20021,"So Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&rdquo;"
4513,3745,0,John,20022,"And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit."
4514,3746,0,John,20023,"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&rdquo;"
4515,3747,0,John,20024,"Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came."
4516,3748,0,John,20025,"The other disciples therefore said to him, &ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo; So he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.&rdquo;"
4517,3749,0,John,20026,"And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, &ldquo;Peace to you!&rdquo;"
4518,3750,0,John,20027,"Then He said to Thomas, &ldquo;Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.&rdquo;"
4519,3751,0,John,20028,"And Thomas answered and said to Him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo;"
4520,3752,0,John,20029,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&rdquo;"
4521,3753,0,John,20030,"And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book;"
4522,3754,0,John,20031,"but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name."
4523,3755,0,John,21001,"After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way He showed Himself:"
4524,3756,0,John,21002,"Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together."
4525,3757,0,John,21003,"Simon Peter said to them, &ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We are going with you also.&rdquo; They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing."
4526,3758,0,John,21004,"But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus."
4527,3759,0,John,21005,"Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Children, have you any food?&rdquo; They answered Him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;"
4528,3760,0,John,21006,"And He said to them, &ldquo;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&rdquo; So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish."
4529,3761,0,John,21007,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord!&rdquo; Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and plunged into the sea."
4530,3762,0,John,21008,"But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish."
4531,3763,0,John,21009,"Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread."
4532,3764,0,John,21010,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.&rdquo;"
4533,3765,0,John,21011,"Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken."
4534,3766,0,John,21012,"Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and eat breakfast.&rdquo; Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; &ndash; knowing that it was the Lord."
4535,3767,0,John,21013,"Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish."
4536,3768,0,John,21014,This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.
4537,3769,0,John,21015,"So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; He said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Feed My lambs.&rdquo;"
4538,3770,0,John,21016,"He said to him again a second time, &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?&rdquo; He said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Tend My sheep.&rdquo;"
4539,3771,0,John,21017,"He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?&rdquo; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; And he said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed My sheep."
4540,3772,0,John,21018,"Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.&rdquo;"
4541,3773,0,John,21019,"This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me.&rdquo;"
4542,3774,0,John,21020,"Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, &ldquo;Lord, who is the one who betrays You?&rdquo;"
4543,3775,0,John,21021,"Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, &ldquo;But Lord, what about this man?&rdquo;"
4544,3776,0,John,21022,"Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.&rdquo;"
4545,3777,0,John,21023,"Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, &ldquo;If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?&rdquo;"
4546,3778,0,John,21024,"This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true."
4547,3779,0,John,21025,"And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen."
4548,3780,0,Acts,1001,"The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
4549,3781,0,Acts,1002,"until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen,"
4550,3782,0,Acts,1003,"to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God."
4551,3783,0,Acts,1004,"And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;you have heard from Me;"
4552,3784,0,Acts,1005,"for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo;"
4553,3785,0,Acts,1006,"Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo;"
4554,3786,0,Acts,1007,"And He said to them, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority."
4555,3787,0,Acts,1008,"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.&rdquo;"
4556,3788,0,Acts,1009,"Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight."
4557,3789,0,Acts,1010,"And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,"
4558,3790,0,Acts,1011,"who also said, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&rdquo;"
4559,3791,0,Acts,1012,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey."
4560,3792,0,Acts,1013,"And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James."
4561,3793,0,Acts,1014,"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers."
4562,3794,0,Acts,1015,"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,"
4563,3795,0,Acts,1016,"&ldquo;Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus;"
4564,3796,0,Acts,1017,"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.&rdquo;"
4565,3797,0,Acts,1018,"(Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out."
4566,3798,0,Acts,1019,"And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)"
4567,3799,0,Acts,1020,"For it is written in the Book of Psalms: &lsquo;Let his dwelling place be desolate, and let no one live in it&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;Let another take his office.&rsquo; "
4568,3800,0,Acts,1021,"Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
4569,3801,0,Acts,1022,"beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&rdquo;"
4570,3802,0,Acts,1023,"And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
4571,3803,0,Acts,1024,"And they prayed and said, &ldquo;You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen"
4572,3804,0,Acts,1025,"to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.&rdquo;"
4573,3805,0,Acts,1026,"And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
4574,3806,0,Acts,2001,"When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place."
4575,3807,0,Acts,2002,"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting."
4576,3808,0,Acts,2003,"Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them."
4577,3809,0,Acts,2004,"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
4578,3810,0,Acts,2005,"And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven."
4579,3811,0,Acts,2006,"And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language."
4580,3812,0,Acts,2007,"Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, &ldquo;Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?"
4581,3813,0,Acts,2008,"And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?"
4582,3814,0,Acts,2009,"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,"

4584,3816,0,Acts,2011,"Cretans and Arabs &ndash; we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.&rdquo;"
4585,3817,0,Acts,2012,"So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &ldquo;Whatever could this mean?&rdquo;"
4586,3818,0,Acts,2013,"Others mocking said, &ldquo;They are full of new wine.&rdquo;"
4587,3819,0,Acts,2014,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, &ldquo;Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words."

4589,3821,0,Acts,2016,But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
4590,3822,0,Acts,2017,"&lsquo;And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams."
4591,3823,0,Acts,2018,"And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy."
4592,3824,0,Acts,2019,I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

4594,3826,0,Acts,2021,"And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the Name of the LORD shall be saved.&rsquo; "
4595,3827,0,Acts,2022,"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know &ndash; "
4596,3828,0,Acts,2023,"Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death;"
4597,3829,0,Acts,2024,"whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it."
4598,3830,0,Acts,2025,"For David says concerning Him: &lsquo;I foresaw the LORD always before my face, for He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken."
4599,3831,0,Acts,2026,"Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad; moreover my flesh also will rest in hope."
4600,3832,0,Acts,2027,"For You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption."

4602,3834,0,Acts,2029,"Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day."
4603,3835,0,Acts,2030,"Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, "
4604,3836,0,Acts,2031,"he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption."
4605,3837,0,Acts,2032,"This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses."
4606,3838,0,Acts,2033,"Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear."
4607,3839,0,Acts,2034,"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself: &lsquo;The LORD said to my Lord, sit at My right hand,"
4608,3840,0,Acts,2035,"till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&rsquo;&rdquo;  "

4610,5543,0,1Cor,14010,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without significance."
4611,5544,0,1Cor,14011,"Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me."
4612,5545,0,1Cor,14012,"Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, let it be for the edification of the church that you seek to excel."
4613,5546,0,1Cor,14013,Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
4614,5547,0,1Cor,14014,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
4615,5548,0,1Cor,14015,"What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding."
4616,5549,0,1Cor,14016,"Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?"
4617,5550,0,1Cor,14017,"For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified."
4618,5551,0,1Cor,14018,"I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;"
4619,5552,0,1Cor,14019,"yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue."
4620,5553,0,1Cor,14020,"Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be mature."
4621,5554,0,1Cor,14021,"In the law it is written: &ldquo;With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,&rdquo; says the Lord."
4622,5555,0,1Cor,14022,"Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe."
4623,5556,0,1Cor,14023,"Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those who are uninformed or unbelievers, will they not say that you are out of your mind?"
4624,5557,0,1Cor,14024,"But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all."
4625,5558,0,1Cor,14025,"And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you."
4626,5559,0,1Cor,14026,"How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification."
4627,5560,0,1Cor,14027,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret."
4628,5561,0,1Cor,14028,"But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God."
4629,5562,0,1Cor,14029,"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge."
4630,5563,0,1Cor,14030,"But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent."
4631,5564,0,1Cor,14031,"For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged."
4632,5565,0,1Cor,14032,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
4633,5566,0,1Cor,14033,"For God is not the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints."
4634,5567,0,1Cor,14034,"Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says."
4635,5568,0,1Cor,14035,"And if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church."
4636,5569,0,1Cor,14036,Or did the word of God come originally from you? Or was it you only that it reached?
4637,5570,0,1Cor,14037,"If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord."
4638,5571,0,1Cor,14038,"But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant."
4639,5572,0,1Cor,14039,"Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues."
4640,5573,0,1Cor,14040,Let all things be done decently and in order.
4641,5574,0,1Cor,15001,"Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,"
4642,5575,0,1Cor,15002,"by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you &ndash; unless you believed in vain."
4643,5576,0,1Cor,15003,"For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
4644,5577,0,1Cor,15004,"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,"
4645,5578,0,1Cor,15005,"and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve."
4646,5579,0,1Cor,15006,"After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep."
4647,5580,0,1Cor,15007,"After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles."
4648,5581,0,1Cor,15008,"Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time."
4649,5582,0,1Cor,15009,"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
4650,5583,0,1Cor,15010,"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
4651,5584,0,1Cor,15011,"Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed."
4652,5585,0,1Cor,15012,"Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
4653,5586,0,1Cor,15013,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen."
4654,5587,0,1Cor,15014,"And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty."
4655,5588,0,1Cor,15015,"Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up &ndash; if in fact the dead do not rise."
4656,5589,0,1Cor,15016,"For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen."
4657,5590,0,1Cor,15017,"And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!"
4658,5591,0,1Cor,15018,Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
4659,5592,0,1Cor,15019,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable."
4660,5593,0,1Cor,15020,"But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."
4661,5594,0,1Cor,15021,"For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead."
4662,5595,0,1Cor,15022,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive."
4663,5596,0,1Cor,15023,"But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming."
4664,5597,0,1Cor,15024,"Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power."
4665,5598,0,1Cor,15025,For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.
4666,5599,0,1Cor,15026,The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.
4667,5600,0,1Cor,15027,"For &ldquo;He has put all things under His feet.&rdquo; But when He says, &ldquo;All things are put under Him,&rdquo; it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted."
4668,5601,0,1Cor,15028,"Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all."
4669,5602,0,1Cor,15029,"Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?"
4670,5603,0,1Cor,15030,And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour?
4671,5604,0,1Cor,15031,"I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
4672,5605,0,1Cor,15032,"If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me? If the dead do not rise, &ldquo;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!&rdquo;"
4673,5606,0,1Cor,15033,"Do not be deceived: &ldquo;Evil company corrupts good habits.&rdquo;"
4674,5607,0,1Cor,15034,"Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame."
4675,5608,0,1Cor,15035,"But someone will say, &ldquo;How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?&rdquo;"
4676,5609,0,1Cor,15036,"Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies."
4677,5610,0,1Cor,15037,"And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain &ndash; perhaps wheat or some other grain."
4678,5611,0,1Cor,15038,"But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body."
4679,5612,0,1Cor,15039,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds."
4680,5613,0,1Cor,15040,"There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
4681,5614,0,1Cor,15041,"There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory."
4682,5615,0,1Cor,15042,"So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption."
4683,5616,0,1Cor,15043,"It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power."
4684,5617,0,1Cor,15044,"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
4685,5618,0,1Cor,15045,"And so it is written, &ldquo;The first man Adam became a living being.&rdquo; The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
4686,5619,0,1Cor,15046,"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual."
4687,5620,0,1Cor,15047,"The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven."
4688,5621,0,1Cor,15048,"As was the man of dust, so also are those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly Man, so also are those who are heavenly."
4689,5622,0,1Cor,15049,"And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man."
4690,5623,0,1Cor,15050,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption."
4691,5624,0,1Cor,15051,"Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed &ndash; "
4692,5625,0,1Cor,15052,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
4693,5626,0,1Cor,15053,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
4694,5627,0,1Cor,15054,"So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: &ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory.&rdquo;"
4695,5628,0,1Cor,15055,"O Death, where is your sting? O Hell, where is your victory?"
4696,3842,0,Acts,2037,"Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &ldquo;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo;"
4697,3843,0,Acts,2038,"Then Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
4698,3844,0,Acts,2039,"For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&rdquo;"
4699,3845,0,Acts,2040,"And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, &ldquo;Be saved from this perverse generation.&rdquo;"
4700,3846,0,Acts,2041,"Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them."
4701,3847,0,Acts,2042,"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers."
4702,3848,0,Acts,2043,"Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles."
4703,3849,0,Acts,2044,"Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common,"
4704,3850,0,Acts,2045,"and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need."
4705,3851,0,Acts,2046,"So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,"
4706,3852,0,Acts,2047,praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.
4707,3853,0,Acts,3001,"Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour."
4708,3854,0,Acts,3002,"And a certain man lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple;"
4709,3855,0,Acts,3003,"who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms."
4710,3856,0,Acts,3004,"And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, &ldquo;Look at us.&rdquo;"
4711,3857,0,Acts,3005,"So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them."
4712,3858,0,Acts,3006,"Then Peter said, &ldquo;Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&rdquo;"
4713,3859,0,Acts,3007,"And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength."
4714,3860,0,Acts,3008,"So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them &ndash; walking, leaping, and praising God."
4715,3861,0,Acts,3009,And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
4716,3862,0,Acts,3010,"Then they knew that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
4717,3863,0,Acts,3011,"Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon&rsquo;s, greatly amazed."
4718,3864,0,Acts,3012,"So when Peter saw it, he responded to the people: &ldquo;Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?"
4719,3865,0,Acts,3013,"The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go."
4720,3866,0,Acts,3014,"But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,"
4721,3867,0,Acts,3015,"and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses."
4722,3868,0,Acts,3016,"And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
4723,3869,0,Acts,3017,"Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers."
4724,3870,0,Acts,3018,"But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled."

4728,3874,0,Acts,3022,"For Moses truly said to the fathers, &lsquo;The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you."

4733,3879,0,Acts,4001,"Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,"
4734,3880,0,Acts,4002,being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
4735,3881,0,Acts,4003,"And they laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening."
4736,3882,0,Acts,4004,"However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand."
4737,3883,0,Acts,4005,"And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes,"
4738,3884,0,Acts,4006,"as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
4739,3885,0,Acts,4007,"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, &ldquo;By what power or by what name have you done this?&rdquo;"
4740,3886,0,Acts,4008,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders of Israel:"

4745,3891,0,Acts,4013,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus."
4746,3892,0,Acts,4014,"And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
4747,3893,0,Acts,4015,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
4748,3894,0,Acts,4016,"saying, &ldquo;What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle has been done through them is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
4749,3895,0,Acts,4017,"But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this name.&rdquo;"
4750,3896,0,Acts,4018,So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
4751,3897,0,Acts,4019,"But Peter and John answered and said to them, &ldquo;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge."
4752,3898,0,Acts,4020,"For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.&rdquo;"
4753,3899,0,Acts,4021,"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done."
4754,3900,0,Acts,4022,For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
4755,3901,0,Acts,4023,"And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them."
4756,3902,0,Acts,4024,"So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: &ldquo;Lord, You are God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them,"
4757,3903,0,Acts,4025,"who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: &lsquo;Why did the nations rage, and the people plot vain things?"
4758,3904,0,Acts,4026,"The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were gathered together against the LORD and against His Christ.&rsquo; "
4759,3905,0,Acts,4027,"For truly against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together"
4760,3906,0,Acts,4028,to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done.
4761,3907,0,Acts,4029,"Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word,"
4762,3908,0,Acts,4030,"by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.&rdquo;"
4763,3909,0,Acts,4031,"And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness."
4764,3910,0,Acts,4032,"Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common."
4765,3911,0,Acts,4033,And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.
4766,3912,0,Acts,4034,"Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,"
4767,3913,0,Acts,4035,"and laid them at the apostles&rsquo; feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need."
4768,3914,0,Acts,4036,"And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus,"
4769,3915,0,Acts,4037,"having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet."
4770,3916,0,Acts,5001,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession."
4771,3917,0,Acts,5002,"And he kept back part of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet."
4772,3918,0,Acts,5003,"But Peter said, &ldquo;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself?"
4773,3919,0,Acts,5004,"While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.&rdquo;"
4774,3920,0,Acts,5005,"Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and breathed his last. So great fear came upon all those who heard these things."
4775,3921,0,Acts,5006,"And the young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him."
4776,3922,0,Acts,5007,"Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."
4777,3923,0,Acts,5008,"And Peter answered her, &ldquo;Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, for so much.&rdquo;"
4778,3924,0,Acts,5009,"Then Peter said to her, &ldquo;How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.&rdquo;"
4779,3925,0,Acts,5010,"Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her by her husband."
4780,3926,0,Acts,5011,So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.
4781,3927,0,Acts,5012,"And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon&rsquo;s Porch."
4782,3928,0,Acts,5013,"Yet none of the rest dared join them, but the people esteemed them highly."
4783,3929,0,Acts,5014,"And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,"
4784,3930,0,Acts,5015,"so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them."
4785,3931,0,Acts,5016,"Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed."
4786,3932,0,Acts,5017,"Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation,"
4787,3933,0,Acts,5018,and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.
4788,3934,0,Acts,5019,"But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,"
4789,3935,0,Acts,5020,"&ldquo;Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.&rdquo;"
4790,3936,0,Acts,5021,"And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
4791,3937,0,Acts,5022,"But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported,"
4792,3938,0,Acts,5023,"saying, &ldquo;Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!&rdquo;"
4793,3939,0,Acts,5024,"Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they wondered what the outcome would be."
4794,3940,0,Acts,5025,"So one came and told them, saying, &ldquo;Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!&rdquo;"
4795,3941,0,Acts,5026,"Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned."
4796,3942,0,Acts,5027,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,"
4797,3943,0,Acts,5028,"saying, &ldquo;Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man&rsquo;s blood on us!&rdquo;"
4798,3944,0,Acts,5029,"But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: &ldquo;We ought to obey God rather than men."
4799,3945,0,Acts,5030,The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree.
4800,3946,0,Acts,5031,"Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."
4801,3947,0,Acts,5032,"And we are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.&rdquo;"
4802,3948,0,Acts,5033,"When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them."
4803,3949,0,Acts,5034,"Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while."
4804,3950,0,Acts,5035,"And he said to them: &ldquo;Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men."
4805,3951,0,Acts,5036,"For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing."
4806,3952,0,Acts,5037,"After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed."
4807,3953,0,Acts,5038,"And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;"
4808,3954,0,Acts,5039,"but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it &ndash; lest you even be found to fight against God.&rdquo;"
4809,3955,0,Acts,5040,"And they agreed with him, and when they had called for the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
4810,3956,0,Acts,5041,"So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name."
4811,3957,0,Acts,5042,"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ."
4812,3958,0,Acts,6001,"Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution."
4813,3959,0,Acts,6002,"Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, &ldquo;It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables."
4814,3960,0,Acts,6003,"Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business;"
4815,3961,0,Acts,6004,"but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.&rdquo;"
4816,3962,0,Acts,6005,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,"
4817,3963,0,Acts,6006,"whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid hands on them."
4818,3964,0,Acts,6007,"Then the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith."
4819,3965,0,Acts,6008,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people."
4820,3966,0,Acts,6009,"Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen."
4821,3967,0,Acts,6010,And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
4822,4062,0,Acts,8030,"So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, &ldquo;Do you understand what you are reading?&rdquo;"
4823,4063,0,Acts,8031,"And he said, &ldquo;How can I, unless someone guides me?&rdquo; And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him."
4824,4064,0,Acts,8032,"The place in the Scripture which he read was this: &ldquo;He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He opened not His mouth."
4825,4065,0,Acts,8033,"In His humiliation His justice was taken away, and who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.&rdquo; "
4826,4066,0,Acts,8034,"So the eunuch answered Philip and said, &ldquo;I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?&rdquo;"
4827,4067,0,Acts,8035,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him."
4828,4068,0,Acts,8036,"Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, &ldquo;See, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?&rdquo;"
4829,4069,0,Acts,8037,"Then Philip said, &ldquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may.&rdquo; And he answered and said, &ldquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rdquo; "
4830,4070,0,Acts,8038,"So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him."
4831,4071,0,Acts,8039,"Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing."
4832,4072,0,Acts,8040,"But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea."
4833,4073,0,Acts,9001,"Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest"
4834,4074,0,Acts,9002,"and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
4835,4075,0,Acts,9003,"As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven."
4836,4076,0,Acts,9004,"Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo;"
4837,4077,0,Acts,9005,"And he said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; Then the Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&rdquo;"
4838,4078,0,Acts,9006,"So he, trembling and astonished, said, &ldquo;Lord, what do You want me to do?&rdquo; Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.&rdquo;"
4839,4079,0,Acts,9007,"And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one."
4840,4080,0,Acts,9008,"Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus."
4841,4081,0,Acts,9009,"And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank."
4842,4082,0,Acts,9010,"Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&rdquo;"
4843,4083,0,Acts,9011,"So the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying."
4844,4084,0,Acts,9012,"And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.&rdquo;"
4845,4085,0,Acts,9013,"Then Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem."
4846,4086,0,Acts,9014,"And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.&rdquo;"
4847,4087,0,Acts,9015,"But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel."
4848,4088,0,Acts,9016,"For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;"
4849,4089,0,Acts,9017,"And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;"
4850,4090,0,Acts,9018,"Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized."
4851,4091,0,Acts,9019,"So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus."
4852,4092,0,Acts,9020,"Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God."
4853,4093,0,Acts,9021,"Then all who heard were amazed, and said, &ldquo;Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?&rdquo;"
4854,4094,0,Acts,9022,"But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ."
4855,4095,0,Acts,9023,"Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him."
4856,4096,0,Acts,9024,"But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him."
4857,4097,0,Acts,9025,Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a large basket.
4858,4098,0,Acts,9026,"And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple."
4859,4099,0,Acts,9027,"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
4860,4100,0,Acts,9028,"So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out."
4861,4101,0,Acts,9029,"And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him."
4862,4102,0,Acts,9030,"When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus."
4863,4103,0,Acts,9031,"Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied."
4864,4104,0,Acts,9032,"Now it came to pass, as Peter went through all parts of the country, that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda."
4865,4105,0,Acts,9033,"There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed."
4866,4106,0,Acts,9034,"And Peter said to him, &ldquo;Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed.&rdquo; Then he arose immediately."
4867,4107,0,Acts,9035,So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
4868,4108,0,Acts,9036,"At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did."
4869,4109,0,Acts,9037,"But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room."
4870,4110,0,Acts,9038,"And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them."
4871,4111,0,Acts,9039,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them."
4872,4112,0,Acts,9040,"But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, &ldquo;Tabitha, arise.&rdquo; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up."
4873,4113,0,Acts,9041,"Then he gave her his hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive."
4874,4114,0,Acts,9042,"And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord."
4875,4115,0,Acts,9043,"So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner."
4876,4116,0,Acts,10001,"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,"
4877,4117,0,Acts,10002,"a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always."
4878,4118,0,Acts,10003,"About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, &ldquo;Cornelius!&rdquo;"
4879,4119,0,Acts,10004,"And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, &ldquo;What is it, lord?&rdquo; So he said to him, &ldquo;Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God."
4880,4120,0,Acts,10005,"Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter."
4881,4121,0,Acts,10006,"He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you must do.&rdquo;"
4882,4122,0,Acts,10007,"And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually."
4883,4123,0,Acts,10008,"So when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa."
4884,4124,0,Acts,10009,"The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour."
4885,4125,0,Acts,10010,"Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance"
4886,4126,0,Acts,10011,"and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth."
4887,4127,0,Acts,10012,"In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air."
4888,4128,0,Acts,10013,"And a voice came to him, &ldquo;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&rdquo;"
4889,4129,0,Acts,10014,"But Peter said, &ldquo;Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.&rdquo;"
4890,4130,0,Acts,10015,"And a voice spoke to him again the second time, &ldquo;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&rdquo;"
4891,4131,0,Acts,10016,This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.
4892,4132,0,Acts,10017,"Now while Peter wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon&rsquo;s house, and stood before the gate."
4893,4133,0,Acts,10018,"And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there."
4894,4134,0,Acts,10019,"While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, &ldquo;Behold, three men are seeking you."
4895,4135,0,Acts,10020,"Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.&rdquo;"
4896,4136,0,Acts,10021,"Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, &ldquo;Yes, I am he whom you seek. For what reason have you come?&rdquo;"
4897,4137,0,Acts,10022,"And they said, &ldquo;Cornelius the centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.&rdquo;"
4898,4138,0,Acts,10023,"Then he invited them in and lodged them. On the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
4899,4139,0,Acts,10024,"And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends."
4900,4140,0,Acts,10025,"As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him."
4901,4141,0,Acts,10026,"But Peter lifted him up, saying, &ldquo;Stand up; I myself am also a man.&rdquo;"
4902,4142,0,Acts,10027,"And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together."
4903,4143,0,Acts,10028,"Then he said to them, &ldquo;You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
4904,4144,0,Acts,10029,"Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?&rdquo;"
4905,4145,0,Acts,10030,"So Cornelius said, &ldquo;Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
4906,4146,0,Acts,10031,"and said, &lsquo;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God."
4907,4147,0,Acts,10032,"Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.&rsquo;"
4908,4148,0,Acts,10033,"So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.&rdquo;"
4909,4149,0,Acts,10034,"Then Peter opened his mouth and said: &ldquo;In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality."
4910,4150,0,Acts,10035,But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.
4911,4151,0,Acts,10036,"The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ &ndash; He is Lord of all &ndash; "
4912,4152,0,Acts,10037,"that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:"
4913,4153,0,Acts,10038,"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him."
4914,4154,0,Acts,10039,"And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed by hanging on a tree."
4915,4155,0,Acts,10040,"Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly,"
4916,4156,0,Acts,10041,"not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead."
4917,4157,0,Acts,10042,"And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead."
4918,4158,0,Acts,10043,"To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.&rdquo;"
4919,4159,0,Acts,10044,"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word."
4920,4160,0,Acts,10045,"And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also."
4921,4161,0,Acts,10046,"For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,"
4922,4162,0,Acts,10047,"&ldquo;Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&rdquo;"
4923,4163,0,Acts,10048,And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.
4924,4164,0,Acts,11001,Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
4925,4165,0,Acts,11002,"And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,"
4926,4166,0,Acts,11003,"saying, &ldquo;You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!&rdquo;"
4927,4167,0,Acts,11004,"But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying:"
4928,4168,0,Acts,11005,"&ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me."
4929,4169,0,Acts,11006,"When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air."
4930,4170,0,Acts,11007,"And I heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&rsquo;"
4931,4171,0,Acts,11008,"But I said, &lsquo;Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.&rsquo;"
4932,4172,0,Acts,11009,"But the voice answered me again from heaven, &lsquo;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&rsquo;"
4933,4173,0,Acts,11010,"Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven."
4934,4174,0,Acts,11011,"At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea."
4935,4175,0,Acts,11012,"Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man&rsquo;s house."
4936,4176,0,Acts,11013,"And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, &lsquo;Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter,"
4937,4177,0,Acts,11014,"who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.&rsquo;"
4938,4178,0,Acts,11015,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning."
4939,4179,0,Acts,11016,"Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, &lsquo;John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;"
4940,4180,0,Acts,11017,"If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?&rdquo;"
4941,4181,0,Acts,11018,"When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.&rdquo;"
4942,4182,0,Acts,11019,"Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only."
4943,4183,0,Acts,11020,"But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus."
4944,4184,0,Acts,11021,"And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord."
4945,4185,0,Acts,11022,"Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch."
4946,4186,0,Acts,11023,"When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord."
4947,4187,0,Acts,11024,"For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord."
4948,4188,0,Acts,11025,Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul.
4949,4189,0,Acts,11026,"And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch."
4950,4190,0,Acts,11027,And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.
4951,4191,0,Acts,11028,"Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar."
4952,4192,0,Acts,11029,"Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea."
4953,4193,0,Acts,11030,"This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
4954,4194,0,Acts,12001,Now about that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to harass some from the church.
4955,4195,0,Acts,12002,Then he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
4956,4196,0,Acts,12003,"And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. Now it was during the Days of Unleavened Bread."
4957,4197,0,Acts,12004,"So when he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him before the people after Passover."
4958,4198,0,Acts,12005,"Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church."
4959,4199,0,Acts,12006,"And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison."
4960,4200,0,Acts,12007,"Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, &ldquo;Arise quickly!&rdquo; And his chains fell off his hands."
4961,4201,0,Acts,12008,"Then the angel said to him, &ldquo;Gird yourself and tie on your sandals&rdquo;; and so he did. And he said to him, &ldquo;Put on your garment and follow me.&rdquo;"
4962,4202,0,Acts,12009,"So he went out and followed him, and did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision."
4963,4203,0,Acts,12010,"When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him."
4964,4204,0,Acts,12011,"And when Peter had come to himself, he said, &ldquo;Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.&rdquo;"
4965,4205,0,Acts,12012,"So, when he had considered this, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying."
4966,4206,0,Acts,12013,"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to answer."
4967,4207,0,Acts,12014,"When she recognized Peter&rsquo;s voice, because of her gladness she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate."
4968,4208,0,Acts,12015,"But they said to her, &ldquo;You are beside yourself!&rdquo; Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, &ldquo;It is his angel.&rdquo;"
4969,4209,0,Acts,12016,"Now Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished."
4970,4210,0,Acts,12017,"But motioning to them with his hand to keep silent, he declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, &ldquo;Go, tell these things to James and to the brethren.&rdquo; And he departed and went to another place."
4971,4211,0,Acts,12018,"Then, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter."
4972,4212,0,Acts,12019,"But when Herod had searched for him and not found him, he examined the guards and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there."
4973,4213,0,Acts,12020,"Now Herod had been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus the king&rsquo;s personal aide their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was supplied with food by the king&rsquo;s country."
4974,4214,0,Acts,12021,"So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne and gave an oration to them."
4975,4215,0,Acts,12022,"And the people kept shouting, &ldquo;The voice of a god and not of a man!&rdquo;"
4976,4216,0,Acts,12023,"Then immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died."
4977,4217,0,Acts,12024,But the word of God grew and multiplied.
4978,4218,0,Acts,12025,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry, and they also took with them John whose surname was Mark."
4979,4219,0,Acts,13001,"Now in the church that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
4980,4220,0,Acts,13002,"As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo;"
4981,4221,0,Acts,13003,"Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away."
4982,4222,0,Acts,13004,"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
4983,4223,0,Acts,13005,"And when they arrived in Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as their assistant."
4984,4224,0,Acts,13006,"Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,"
4985,4225,0,Acts,13007,"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God."
4986,4226,0,Acts,13008,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith."
4987,4227,0,Acts,13009,"Then Saul, who also is called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him"
4988,4228,0,Acts,13010,"and said, &ldquo;O full of all deceit and all fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?"
4989,4229,0,Acts,13011,"And now, indeed, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.&rdquo; And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand."
4990,4230,0,Acts,13012,"Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord."
4991,4231,0,Acts,13013,"Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem."
4992,4232,0,Acts,13014,"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down."
4993,4233,0,Acts,13015,"And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, &ldquo;Men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.&rdquo;"
4994,4234,0,Acts,13016,"Then Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, &ldquo;Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:"
4995,4235,0,Acts,13017,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it."
4996,4236,0,Acts,13018,Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness.
4997,4237,0,Acts,13019,"And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment."
4998,4238,0,Acts,13020,"After that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet."
4999,4239,0,Acts,13021,"And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
5000,4240,0,Acts,13022,"And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, &lsquo;I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.&rsquo; "
5001,4241,0,Acts,13023,"From this man&rsquo;s seed, according to the promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior &ndash; Jesus &ndash; "
5002,4242,0,Acts,13024,"after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
5003,4243,0,Acts,13025,"And as John was finishing his course, he said, &lsquo;Who do you think I am? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.&rsquo;"
5004,4244,0,Acts,13026,"Men and brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation has been sent."
5005,4245,0,Acts,13027,"For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled them in condemning Him."
5006,4246,0,Acts,13028,"And though they found no cause for death in Him, they asked Pilate that He should be put to death."
5007,4247,0,Acts,13029,"Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb."
5008,4248,0,Acts,13030,But God raised Him from the dead.
5009,4249,0,Acts,13031,"He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people."
5010,4250,0,Acts,13032,"And we declare to you glad tidings &ndash; that promise which was made to the fathers."
5011,4251,0,Acts,13033,"God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: &lsquo;You are My Son, today I have begotten You.&rsquo; "
5012,4252,0,Acts,13034,"And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus: &lsquo;I will give you the sure mercies of David.&rsquo; "
5013,4253,0,Acts,13035,"Therefore He also says in another Psalm: &lsquo;You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.&rsquo; "
5014,4254,0,Acts,13036,"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption;"
5015,4255,0,Acts,13037,but He whom God raised up saw no corruption.
5016,4256,0,Acts,13038,"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this Man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins;"
5017,4257,0,Acts,13039,and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
5018,4258,0,Acts,13040,"Beware therefore, lest what has been spoken in the prophets come upon you:"
5019,4259,0,Acts,13041,"&lsquo;Behold, you despisers, marvel and perish! For I work a work in your days, a work which you will by no means believe, though one were to declare it to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5020,4260,0,Acts,13042,"So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath."
5021,4261,0,Acts,13043,"Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
5022,4262,0,Acts,13044,On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.
5023,4263,0,Acts,13045,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul."
5024,4264,0,Acts,13046,"Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, &ldquo;It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles."
5025,4265,0,Acts,13047,"For so the Lord has commanded us: &lsquo;I have set you as a light to the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5026,4266,0,Acts,13048,"Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed."
5027,4267,0,Acts,13049,And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region.
5028,4268,0,Acts,13050,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region."
5029,4269,0,Acts,13051,"But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium."
5030,4270,0,Acts,13052,And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
5031,4271,0,Acts,14001,"Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed."
5032,4272,0,Acts,14002,But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.
5033,4273,0,Acts,14003,"Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
5034,4274,0,Acts,14004,"But the multitude of the city was divided: part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
5035,4275,0,Acts,14005,"And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to abuse and stone them,"
5036,4276,0,Acts,14006,"they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region."
5037,4277,0,Acts,14007,And they were preaching the gospel there.
5038,4278,0,Acts,14008,"And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother&rsquo;s womb, who had never walked."
5039,4279,0,Acts,14009,"This man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,"
5040,4280,0,Acts,14010,"said with a loud voice, &ldquo;Stand up straight on your feet!&rdquo; And he leaped and walked."
5041,4281,0,Acts,14011,"Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, &ldquo;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&rdquo;"
5042,4282,0,Acts,14012,"And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker."
5043,4283,0,Acts,14013,"Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, intending to sacrifice with the multitudes."
5044,4284,0,Acts,14014,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and ran in among the multitude, crying out"
5045,4285,0,Acts,14015,"and saying, &ldquo;Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,"
5046,4286,0,Acts,14016,who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.
5047,4287,0,Acts,14017,"Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.&rdquo;"
5048,4288,0,Acts,14018,And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
5049,4289,0,Acts,14019,"Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead."
5050,4290,0,Acts,14020,"However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
5051,4291,0,Acts,14021,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,"
5052,4292,0,Acts,14022,"strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, &ldquo;We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
5053,4293,0,Acts,14023,"So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
5054,4294,0,Acts,14024,"And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
5055,4295,0,Acts,14025,"Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia."
5056,4296,0,Acts,14026,"From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed."
5057,4297,0,Acts,14027,"Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles."
5058,4298,0,Acts,14028,So they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
5059,4299,0,Acts,15001,"And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, &ldquo;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&rdquo;"
5060,4300,0,Acts,15002,"Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question."
5061,4301,0,Acts,15003,"So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren."
5062,4302,0,Acts,15004,"And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them."
5063,4303,0,Acts,15005,"But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &ldquo;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.&rdquo;"
5064,4304,0,Acts,15006,Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.
5065,4305,0,Acts,15007,"And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them: &ldquo;Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe."
5066,4306,0,Acts,15008,"So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,"
5067,4307,0,Acts,15009,"and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
5068,4308,0,Acts,15010,"Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
5069,4309,0,Acts,15011,"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.&rdquo;"
5070,4310,0,Acts,15012,Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles.
5071,4311,0,Acts,15013,"And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, &ldquo;Men and brethren, listen to me:"
5072,4406,0,Acts,17027,"so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;"
5073,4407,0,Acts,17028,"for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, &lsquo;For we are also His offspring.&rsquo;"
5074,4408,0,Acts,17029,"Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man&rsquo;s devising."
5075,4409,0,Acts,17030,"Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,"
5076,4410,0,Acts,17031,"because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.&rdquo;"
5077,4411,0,Acts,17032,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, &ldquo;We will hear you again on this matter.&rdquo;"
5078,4412,0,Acts,17033,So Paul departed from among them.
5079,4413,0,Acts,17034,"However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
5080,4414,0,Acts,18001,After these things Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth.
5081,4415,0,Acts,18002,"And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them."
5082,4416,0,Acts,18003,"So, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for by occupation they were tentmakers."
5083,4417,0,Acts,18004,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks."
5084,4418,0,Acts,18005,"When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ."
5085,4419,0,Acts,18006,"But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, &ldquo;Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&rdquo;"
5086,4420,0,Acts,18007,"And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue."
5087,4421,0,Acts,18008,"Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized."
5088,4422,0,Acts,18009,"Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;"
5089,4423,0,Acts,18010,"for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.&rdquo;"
5090,4424,0,Acts,18011,"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
5091,4425,0,Acts,18012,"When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,"
5092,4426,0,Acts,18013,"saying, &ldquo;This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.&rdquo;"
5093,4427,0,Acts,18014,"And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &ldquo;If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you."
5094,4428,0,Acts,18015,"But if it is a question of words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such matters.&rdquo;"
5095,4429,0,Acts,18016,And he drove them from the judgment seat.
5096,4430,0,Acts,18017,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things."
5097,4431,0,Acts,18018,"So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow."
5098,4432,0,Acts,18019,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews."
5099,4433,0,Acts,18020,"When they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent,"
5100,4434,0,Acts,18021,"but took leave of them, saying, &ldquo;I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing.&rdquo; And he sailed from Ephesus."
5101,4435,0,Acts,18022,"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch."
5102,4436,0,Acts,18023,"After he had spent some time there, he departed and went over the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
5103,4437,0,Acts,18024,"Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus."
5104,4438,0,Acts,18025,"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the baptism of John."
5105,4439,0,Acts,18026,"So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately."
5106,4440,0,Acts,18027,"And when he desired to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;"
5107,4441,0,Acts,18028,"for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ."
5108,4442,0,Acts,19001,"And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples"
5109,4443,0,Acts,19002,"he said to them, &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&rdquo; So they said to him, &ldquo;We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.&rdquo;"
5110,4444,0,Acts,19003,"And he said to them, &ldquo;Into what then were you baptized?&rdquo; So they said, &ldquo;Into John&rsquo;s baptism.&rdquo;"
5111,4445,0,Acts,19004,"Then Paul said, &ldquo;John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.&rdquo;"
5112,4446,0,Acts,19005,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
5113,4447,0,Acts,19006,"And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied."
5114,4448,0,Acts,19007,Now the men were about twelve in all.
5115,4449,0,Acts,19008,"And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God."
5116,4450,0,Acts,19009,"But when some were hardened and did not believe, but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and withdrew the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus."
5117,4451,0,Acts,19010,"And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
5118,4452,0,Acts,19011,"Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul,"
5119,4453,0,Acts,19012,"so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them."
5120,4454,0,Acts,19013,"Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, &ldquo;We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.&rdquo;"
5121,4455,0,Acts,19014,"Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so."
5122,4456,0,Acts,19015,"And the evil spirit answered and said, &ldquo;Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?&rdquo;"
5123,4457,0,Acts,19016,"Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
5124,4458,0,Acts,19017,"This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
5125,4459,0,Acts,19018,And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds.
5126,4460,0,Acts,19019,"Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver."
5127,4461,0,Acts,19020,So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.
5128,4462,0,Acts,19021,"When these things were accomplished, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, &ldquo;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&rdquo;"
5129,4463,0,Acts,19022,"So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time."
5130,4464,0,Acts,19023,And about that time there arose a great commotion about the Way.
5131,4465,0,Acts,19024,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no small profit to the craftsmen."
5132,4466,0,Acts,19025,"He called them together with the workers of similar occupation, and said: &ldquo;Men, you know that we have our prosperity by this trade."
5133,4467,0,Acts,19026,"Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands."
5134,4468,0,Acts,19027,"So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.&rdquo;"
5135,4469,0,Acts,19028,"Now when they heard this, they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, &ldquo;Great is Diana of the Ephesians!&rdquo;"
5136,4470,0,Acts,19029,"So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul&rsquo;s travel companions."
5137,4471,0,Acts,19030,"And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him."
5138,4472,0,Acts,19031,"Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater."
5139,4473,0,Acts,19032,"Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together."
5140,4474,0,Acts,19033,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people."
5141,4475,0,Acts,19034,"But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, &ldquo;Great is Diana of the Ephesians!&rdquo;"
5142,4476,0,Acts,19036,"Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly."
5143,4477,0,Acts,19037,For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
5144,4478,0,Acts,19038,"Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another."
5145,4479,0,Acts,19039,"But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly."
5146,4480,0,Acts,19035,"And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: &ldquo;Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?"
5147,4481,0,Acts,19040,"For we are in danger of being called in question for today&rsquo;s uproar, there being no reason which we may give to account for this disorderly gathering.&rdquo;"
5148,4482,0,Acts,19041,"And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly."
5149,4483,0,Acts,20001,"After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to himself, embraced them, and departed to go to Macedonia."
5150,4484,0,Acts,20002,"Now when he had gone over that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece"
5151,4485,0,Acts,20003,"and stayed three months. And when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia."
5152,4486,0,Acts,20004,"And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia &ndash; also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia."
5153,4487,0,Acts,20005,"These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas."
5154,4488,0,Acts,20006,"But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days joined them at Troas, where we stayed seven days."
5155,4489,0,Acts,20007,"Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight."
5156,4490,0,Acts,20008,There were many lamps in the upper room where they were gathered together.
5157,4491,0,Acts,20009,"And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead."
5158,4492,0,Acts,20010,"But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said, &ldquo;Do not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him.&rdquo;"
5159,4493,0,Acts,20011,"Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed."
5160,4494,0,Acts,20012,"And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted."
5161,4495,0,Acts,20013,"Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so he had given orders, intending himself to go on foot."
5162,4496,0,Acts,20014,"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene."
5163,4497,0,Acts,20015,"We sailed from there, and the next day came opposite Chios. The following day we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day we came to Miletus."
5164,4498,0,Acts,20016,"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost."
5165,4499,0,Acts,20017,From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.
5166,4500,0,Acts,20018,"And when they had come to him, he said to them: &ldquo;You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you,"
5167,4501,0,Acts,20019,"serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews;"
5168,4502,0,Acts,20020,"how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,"
5169,4503,0,Acts,20021,"testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
5170,4504,0,Acts,20022,"And see, now I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,"
5171,4505,0,Acts,20023,"except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me."
5172,4506,0,Acts,20024,"But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God."
5173,4507,0,Acts,20025,"And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more."
5174,4508,0,Acts,20026,Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
5175,4509,0,Acts,20027,For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God.
5176,4510,0,Acts,20028,"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood."
5177,4511,0,Acts,20029,"For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock."
5178,4512,0,Acts,20030,"Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves."
5179,4513,0,Acts,20031,"Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears."
5180,4514,0,Acts,20032,"So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified."
5181,4515,0,Acts,20033,"I have coveted no one&rsquo;s silver or gold or apparel."
5182,4516,0,Acts,20034,"Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me."
5183,4517,0,Acts,20035,"I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, &lsquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5184,4518,0,Acts,20036,"And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all."
5185,4519,0,Acts,20037,"Then they all wept freely, and fell on Paul&rsquo;s neck and kissed him,"
5186,4520,0,Acts,20038,"sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship."
5187,4521,0,Acts,21001,"Now it came to pass, that when we had departed from them and set sail, running a straight course we came to Cos, the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara."
5188,4522,0,Acts,21002,"And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail."
5189,4523,0,Acts,21003,"When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo."
5190,4524,0,Acts,21004,"And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem."
5191,4525,0,Acts,21005,"When we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city. And we knelt down on the shore and prayed."
5192,4526,0,Acts,21006,"When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned home."
5193,4527,0,Acts,21007,"And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day."
5194,4528,0,Acts,21008,"On the next day we who were Paul&rsquo;s companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him."
5195,4529,0,Acts,21009,Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
5196,4530,0,Acts,21010,"And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea."
5197,4531,0,Acts,21011,"When he had come to us, he took Paul&rsquo;s belt, bound his own hands and feet, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the Holy Spirit, &lsquo;So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5198,4532,0,Acts,21012,"Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem."
5199,4533,0,Acts,21013,"Then Paul answered, &ldquo;What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;"
5200,4534,0,Acts,21014,"So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, &ldquo;The will of the Lord be done.&rdquo;"
5201,4535,0,Acts,21015,And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem.
5202,4536,0,Acts,21016,"Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge."
5203,4537,0,Acts,21017,"And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
5204,4538,0,Acts,21018,"On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present."
5205,4539,0,Acts,21019,"When he had greeted them, he told in detail those things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry."
5206,4540,0,Acts,21020,"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, &ldquo;You see, brother, how many myriads of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law;"
5207,4541,0,Acts,21021,"but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs."
5208,4542,0,Acts,21022,"What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come."
5209,4543,0,Acts,21023,Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow.
5210,4544,0,Acts,21024,"Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law."
5211,4545,0,Acts,21025,"But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and decided that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality.&rdquo;"
5212,4546,0,Acts,21026,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, entered the temple to announce the expiration of the days of purification, at which time an offering should be made for each one of them."
5213,4547,0,Acts,21027,"Now when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,"
5214,4548,0,Acts,21028,"crying out, &ldquo;Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.&rdquo;"
5215,4549,0,Acts,21029,"(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
5216,4550,0,Acts,21030,"And all the city was disturbed; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut."
5217,4551,0,Acts,21031,"Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
5218,4552,0,Acts,21032,"He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
5219,4553,0,Acts,21033,"Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done."
5220,4554,0,Acts,21034,"And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another. So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks."
5221,4555,0,Acts,21035,"When he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob."
5222,4556,0,Acts,21036,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, &ldquo;Away with him!&rdquo;"
5223,4557,0,Acts,21037,"Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, &ldquo;May I speak to you?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Can you speak Greek?"
5224,4558,0,Acts,21038,"Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?&rdquo;"
5225,4559,0,Acts,21039,"But Paul said, &ldquo;I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I implore you, permit me to speak to the people.&rdquo;"
5226,4560,0,Acts,21040,"So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,"
5227,4561,0,Acts,22001,"Brethren and fathers, hear my defense before you now."
5228,4562,0,Acts,22002,"And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent. Then he said:"
5229,4563,0,Acts,22003,"&ldquo;I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathers&rsquo; law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today."
5230,4564,0,Acts,22004,"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,"
5231,4565,0,Acts,22005,"as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished."
5232,4566,0,Acts,22006,"Now it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me."
5233,4567,0,Acts,22007,"And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rsquo;"
5234,4568,0,Acts,22008,"So I answered, &lsquo;Who are You, Lord?&rsquo; And He said to me, &lsquo;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.&rsquo;"
5235,4569,0,Acts,22009,"And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me."
5236,4570,0,Acts,22010,"So I said, &lsquo;What shall I do, Lord?&rsquo; And the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.&rsquo;"
5237,4571,0,Acts,22011,"And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus."
5238,4572,0,Acts,22012,"Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt there,"
5239,4573,0,Acts,22013,"came to me; and he stood and said to me, &lsquo;Brother Saul, receive your sight.&rsquo; And at that same hour I looked up at him."
5240,4574,0,Acts,22014,"Then he said, &lsquo;The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of His mouth."
5241,4575,0,Acts,22015,For you will be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
5242,4576,0,Acts,22016,"And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.&rsquo;"
5243,4577,0,Acts,22017,"Now it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance"
5244,4578,0,Acts,22018,"and saw Him saying to me, &lsquo;Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.&rsquo;"
5245,4579,0,Acts,22019,"So I said, &lsquo;Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believe on You."
5246,4580,0,Acts,22020,"And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by consenting to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.&rsquo;"
5247,4581,0,Acts,22021,"Then He said to me, &lsquo;Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5248,4582,0,Acts,22022,"And they listened to him until this word, and then they raised their voices and said, &ldquo;Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he is not fit to live!&rdquo;"
5249,4583,0,Acts,22023,"Then, as they cried out and tore off their clothes and threw dust into the air,"
5250,4584,0,Acts,22024,"the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined under scourging, so that he might know why they shouted so against him."
5251,4585,0,Acts,22025,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, &ldquo;Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?&rdquo;"
5252,4586,0,Acts,22026,"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, &ldquo;Take care what you do, for this man is a Roman.&rdquo;"
5253,4587,0,Acts,22027,"Then the commander came and said to him, &ldquo;Tell me, are you a Roman?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;"
5254,4588,0,Acts,22028,"The commander answered, &ldquo;With a large sum I obtained this citizenship.&rdquo; And Paul said, &ldquo;But I was born a citizen.&rdquo;"
5255,4589,0,Acts,22029,"Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him; and the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
5256,4590,0,Acts,22030,"The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them."
5257,4591,0,Acts,23001,"Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, &ldquo;Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.&rdquo;"
5258,4592,0,Acts,23002,And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
5259,4593,0,Acts,23003,"Then Paul said to him, &ldquo;God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit to judge me according to the law, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the law?&rdquo;"
5260,4594,0,Acts,23004,"And those who stood by said, &ldquo;Do you revile God&rsquo;s high priest?&rdquo;"
5261,4595,0,Acts,23005,"Then Paul said, &ldquo;I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, &lsquo;You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5262,4596,0,Acts,23006,"But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, &ldquo;Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!&rdquo;"
5263,4597,0,Acts,23007,"And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided."
5264,4598,0,Acts,23008,"For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection &ndash; and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees confess both."
5265,4599,0,Acts,23009,"Then there arose a loud outcry. And the scribes of the Pharisees&rsquo; party arose and protested, saying, &ldquo;We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.&rdquo; "
5266,4600,0,Acts,23010,"Now when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks."
5267,4601,0,Acts,23011,"But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, &ldquo;Be of good cheer, Paul; for as you have testified for Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome.&rdquo;"
5268,4602,0,Acts,23012,"And when it was day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
5269,4603,0,Acts,23013,Now there were more than forty who had formed this conspiracy.
5270,4604,0,Acts,23014,"They came to the chief priests and elders, and said, &ldquo;We have bound ourselves under a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul."
5271,4605,0,Acts,23015,"Now you, therefore, together with the council, suggest to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to make further inquiries concerning him; but we are ready to kill him before he comes near.&rdquo;"
5272,4606,0,Acts,23016,"So when Paul&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul."
5273,4607,0,Acts,23017,"Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, &ldquo;Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.&rdquo;"
5274,4608,0,Acts,23018,"So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, &ldquo;Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.&rdquo;"
5275,4609,0,Acts,23019,"Then the commander took him by the hand, went aside, and asked privately, &ldquo;What is it that you have to tell me?&rdquo;"
5276,4610,0,Acts,23020,"And he said, &ldquo;The Jews have agreed to ask that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more fully about him."
5277,4611,0,Acts,23021,"But do not yield to them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.&rdquo;"
5278,4612,0,Acts,23022,"So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded him, &ldquo;Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.&rdquo;"
5279,4613,0,Acts,23023,"And he called for two centurions, saying, &ldquo;Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;"
5280,4614,0,Acts,23024,"and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.&rdquo;"
5281,4615,0,Acts,23025,He wrote a letter in the following manner:
5282,4616,0,Acts,23026,"&ldquo;Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings."
5283,4617,0,Acts,23027,"This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. Coming with the troops I rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman."
5284,4618,0,Acts,23028,"And when I wanted to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council."
5285,4619,0,Acts,23029,"I found out that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but had nothing charged against him deserving of death or chains."
5286,4620,0,Acts,23030,"And when it was told me that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him immediately to you, and also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges against him. Farewell.&rdquo;"
5287,4621,0,Acts,23031,"Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris."
5288,4622,0,Acts,23032,"The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks."
5289,4623,0,Acts,23033,"When they came to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him."
5290,4624,0,Acts,23034,"And when the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,"
5291,4625,0,Acts,23035,"he said, &ldquo;I will hear you when your accusers also have come.&rdquo; And he commanded him to be kept in Herod&rsquo;s Praetorium."
5292,4626,0,Acts,24001,Now after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. These gave evidence to the governor against Paul.
5293,4627,0,Acts,24002,"And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: &ldquo;Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your foresight,"
5294,4628,0,Acts,24003,"we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
5295,4629,0,Acts,24004,"Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us."
5296,4630,0,Acts,24005,"For we have found this man a plague, a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."
5297,4631,0,Acts,24006,"He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and wanted to judge him according to our law."
5298,4632,0,Acts,24007,"But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,"
5299,4633,0,Acts,24008,"commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.&rdquo;"
5300,4634,0,Acts,24009,"And the Jews also assented, maintaining that these things were so."
5301,4635,0,Acts,24010,"Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: &ldquo;Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself,"
5302,4636,0,Acts,24011,because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
5303,4637,0,Acts,24012,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city."
5304,4638,0,Acts,24013,Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
5305,4639,0,Acts,24014,"But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets."
5306,4640,0,Acts,24015,"I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust."
5307,4641,0,Acts,24016,"This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men."
5308,4642,0,Acts,24017,"Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,"
5309,4643,0,Acts,24018,"in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a mob nor with tumult."
5310,4644,0,Acts,24019,They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me.
5311,4645,0,Acts,24020,"Or else let those who are here themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,"
5312,4646,0,Acts,24021,"unless it is for this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, &lsquo;Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
5313,4647,0,Acts,24022,"But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, &ldquo;When Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case.&rdquo;"
5314,4648,0,Acts,24023,"So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him."
5315,4649,0,Acts,24024,"And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
5316,4650,0,Acts,24025,"Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, &ldquo;Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.&rdquo;"
5317,4651,0,Acts,24026,"Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him."
5318,4652,0,Acts,24027,"But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound."
5319,4653,0,Acts,25001,"Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
5320,4654,0,Acts,25002,"Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they petitioned him,"
5321,4655,0,Acts,25003,"asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem &ndash; while they lay in ambush along the road to kill him."
5322,4656,0,Acts,25004,"But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there shortly."
5323,4657,0,Acts,25005,"Therefore, he said, &ldquo;Let those who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man, to see if there is any fault in him.&rdquo;"
5324,4658,0,Acts,25006,"And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought."
5325,4659,0,Acts,25007,"When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about and laid many serious complaints against Paul, which they could not prove,"
5326,4660,0,Acts,25008,"while he answered for himself, &ldquo;Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all.&rdquo;"
5327,4661,0,Acts,25009,"But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, &ldquo;Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?&rdquo;"
5328,4662,0,Acts,25010,"So Paul said, &ldquo;I stand at Caesar&rsquo;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know."
5329,4663,0,Acts,25011,"For if I am an offender, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not object to dying; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.&rdquo;"
5330,4664,0,Acts,25012,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, &ldquo;You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!&rdquo;"
5331,4665,0,Acts,25013,And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.
5332,4666,0,Acts,25014,"When they had been there many days, Festus laid Paul&rsquo;s case before the king, saying: &ldquo;There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,"
5333,4667,0,Acts,25015,"about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him."
5334,4668,0,Acts,25016,"To them I answered, &lsquo;It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the charge against him.&rsquo;"
5335,4669,0,Acts,25017,"Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in."
5336,4670,0,Acts,25018,"When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed,"
5337,4671,0,Acts,25019,"but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
5338,4672,0,Acts,25020,"And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters."
5339,4673,0,Acts,25021,"But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.&rdquo;"
5340,4674,0,Acts,25022,"Then Agrippa said to Festus, &ldquo;I also would like to hear the man myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shall hear him.&rdquo;"
5341,4675,0,Acts,25023,"So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus&rsquo; command Paul was brought in."
5342,4676,0,Acts,25024,"And Festus said: &ldquo;King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was not fit to live any longer."
5343,4677,0,Acts,25025,"But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him."
5344,4678,0,Acts,25026,"I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write."
5345,4679,0,Acts,25027,"For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.&rdquo;"
5346,4680,0,Acts,26001,"Then Agrippa said to Paul, &ldquo;You are permitted to speak for yourself.&rdquo; So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself:"
5347,4681,0,Acts,26002,"&ldquo;I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,"
5348,4682,0,Acts,26003,especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
5349,4683,0,Acts,26004,"My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know."
5350,4684,0,Acts,26005,"They knew me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
5351,4685,0,Acts,26006,And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.
5352,4686,0,Acts,26007,"To this promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. For this hope&rsquo;s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews."
5353,4687,0,Acts,26008,Why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?
5354,4688,0,Acts,26009,"Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
5355,4689,0,Acts,26010,"This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them."
5356,4690,0,Acts,26011,"And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities."
5357,4691,0,Acts,26012,"While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
5358,4692,0,Acts,26013,"at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me."
5359,4693,0,Acts,26014,"And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&rsquo;"
5360,4694,0,Acts,26015,"So I said, &lsquo;Who are You, Lord?&rsquo; And He said, &lsquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."
5361,4695,0,Acts,26016,"But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you."
5362,4696,0,Acts,26017,"I will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,"
5363,4697,0,Acts,26018,"to open their eyes, in order to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.&rsquo;"
5364,4698,0,Acts,26019,"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,"
5365,4699,0,Acts,26020,"but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance."
5366,4700,0,Acts,26021,For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
5367,4701,0,Acts,26022,"Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come &ndash; "
5368,4702,0,Acts,26023,"that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.&rdquo;"
5369,4703,0,Acts,26024,"Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, &ldquo;Paul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!&rdquo;"
5370,4704,0,Acts,26025,"But he said, &ldquo;I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and reason."
5371,4705,0,Acts,26026,"For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things escapes his attention, since this thing was not done in a corner."
5372,4706,0,Acts,26027,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.&rdquo;"
5373,4707,0,Acts,26028,"Then Agrippa said to Paul, &ldquo;You almost persuade me to become a Christian.&rdquo;"
5374,4708,0,Acts,26029,"And Paul said, &ldquo;I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains.&rdquo;"
5375,4709,0,Acts,26030,"When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them;"
5376,4710,0,Acts,26031,"and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, &ldquo;This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.&rdquo;"
5377,4711,0,Acts,26032,"Then Agrippa said to Festus, &ldquo;This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&rdquo;"
5378,4712,0,Acts,27001,"And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment."
5379,4713,0,Acts,27002,"So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us."
5380,4714,0,Acts,27003,And the next day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.
5381,4715,0,Acts,27004,"When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
5382,4716,0,Acts,27005,"And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
5383,4717,0,Acts,27006,"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board."
5384,4718,0,Acts,27007,"When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone."
5385,4719,0,Acts,27008,"Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea."
5386,4720,0,Acts,27009,"Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the Fast was already over, Paul advised them,"
5387,4721,0,Acts,27010,"saying, &ldquo;Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.&rdquo;"
5388,4722,0,Acts,27011,Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul.
5389,4723,0,Acts,27012,"And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, and winter there."
5390,4724,0,Acts,27013,"When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete."
5391,4725,0,Acts,27014,"But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called Euroclydon."
5392,4726,0,Acts,27015,"So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her drive."
5393,4727,0,Acts,27016,"And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty."
5394,4728,0,Acts,27017,"When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the Syrtis Sands, they struck sail and so were driven."
5395,4729,0,Acts,27018,"And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next day they lightened the ship."
5396,4730,0,Acts,27019,"On the third day we threw the ship&rsquo;s tackle overboard with our own hands."
5397,4731,0,Acts,27020,"Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on us, all hope that we would be saved was finally given up."
5398,4732,0,Acts,27021,"But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, &ldquo;Men, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss."
5399,4733,0,Acts,27022,"And now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship."
5400,4734,0,Acts,27023,"For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve,"
5401,4735,0,Acts,27024,"saying, &lsquo;Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.&rsquo;"
5402,4736,0,Acts,27025,"Therefore take heart, men, for I believe God that it will be just as it was told me."
5403,4737,0,Acts,27026,"However, we must run aground on a certain island.&rdquo;"
5404,4738,0,Acts,27027,"Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land."
5405,4739,0,Acts,27028,"And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms."
5406,4740,0,Acts,27029,"Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come."
5407,4741,0,Acts,27030,"And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the skiff into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow,"
5408,4742,0,Acts,27031,"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, &ldquo;Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.&rdquo;"
5409,4743,0,Acts,27032,Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.
5410,4744,0,Acts,27033,"And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored them all to take food, saying, &ldquo;Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing."
5411,4745,0,Acts,27034,"Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.&rdquo;"
5412,4746,0,Acts,27035,"And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat."
5413,4747,0,Acts,27036,"Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves."
5414,4748,0,Acts,27037,And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six persons on the ship.
5415,4749,0,Acts,27038,"So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea."
5416,4750,0,Acts,27039,"When it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible."
5417,4751,0,Acts,27040,"And they let go the anchors and left them in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore."
5418,4752,0,Acts,27041,"But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves."
5419,4753,0,Acts,27042,"And the soldiers&rsquo; plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape."
5420,4754,0,Acts,27043,"But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,"
5421,4755,0,Acts,27044,"and the rest, some on boards and some on parts of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land."
5422,4756,0,Acts,28001,"Now when they had escaped, they then found out that the island was called Malta."
5423,4757,0,Acts,28002,"And the natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold."
5424,4758,0,Acts,28003,"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
5425,4759,0,Acts,28004,"So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, &ldquo;No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.&rdquo;"
5426,4760,0,Acts,28005,But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
5427,4761,0,Acts,28006,"However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god."
5428,4762,0,Acts,28007,"In that region there was an estate of the leading citizen of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and entertained us courteously for three days."
5429,4763,0,Acts,28008,"And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him."
5430,4848,0,Rom,3001,"What advantage then has the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?"
5431,4849,0,Rom,3002,Much in every way! Chiefly because to them were committed the oracles of God.
5432,4850,0,Rom,3003,For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect?
5433,4851,0,Rom,3004,"Certainly not! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar. As it is written: &ldquo;That You may be justified in Your words, and may overcome when You are judged.&rdquo; "
5434,4852,0,Rom,3005,"But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who inflicts wrath? (I speak as a man.)"
5435,4853,0,Rom,3006,Certainly not! For then how will God judge the world?
5436,4854,0,Rom,3007,"For if the truth of God has increased through my lie to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?"
5437,4855,0,Rom,3008,"And why not say, &ldquo;Let us do evil that good may come&rdquo;? &ndash; as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say. Their condemnation is just."
5438,4856,0,Rom,3009,What then? Are we better than they? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.
5439,4857,0,Rom,3010,"As it is written: &ldquo;There is none righteous, no, not one;"
5440,4858,0,Rom,3011,"there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God."
5441,4859,0,Rom,3012,"They have all turned aside; they have together become unprofitable; there is none who does good, no, not one.&rdquo;"
5442,4860,0,Rom,3013,"&ldquo;Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;"
5443,4861,0,Rom,3014,"whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.&rdquo;"
5444,4862,0,Rom,3015,"&ldquo;Their feet are swift to shed blood;"
5445,4863,0,Rom,3016,"destruction and misery are in their ways;"
5446,4864,0,Rom,3017,"and the way of peace they have not known.&rdquo; "
5447,4865,0,Rom,3018,There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
5448,4866,0,Rom,3019,"Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
5449,4867,0,Rom,3020,"Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
5450,4868,0,Rom,3021,"But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,"
5451,4869,0,Rom,3022,"even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference;"
5452,4870,0,Rom,3023,"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"
5453,4871,0,Rom,3024,"being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,"
5454,4872,0,Rom,3025,"whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,"
5455,4873,0,Rom,3026,"to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."
5456,4874,0,Rom,3027,"Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith."
5457,4875,0,Rom,3028,Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.
5458,4876,0,Rom,3029,"Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,"
5459,4877,0,Rom,3030,since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
5460,4878,0,Rom,3031,"Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law."
5461,4879,0,Rom,4001,What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh? 
5462,4880,0,Rom,4002,"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God."
5463,4881,0,Rom,4003,"For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo; "
5464,4882,0,Rom,4004,"Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt."
5465,4883,0,Rom,4005,"But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness,"
5466,4884,0,Rom,4006,just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works:
5467,4885,0,Rom,4007,"&ldquo;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;"
5468,4886,0,Rom,4008,"blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall not impute sin.&rdquo; "
5469,4887,0,Rom,4009,"Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness."
5470,4888,0,Rom,4010,"How then was it accounted? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised."
5471,4889,0,Rom,4011,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also,"
5472,4890,0,Rom,4012,"and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while still uncircumcised."
5473,4891,0,Rom,4013,"For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
5474,4892,0,Rom,4014,"For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect,"
5475,4893,0,Rom,4015,"because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law there is no transgression."
5476,4894,0,Rom,4016,"Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all"
5477,4895,0,Rom,4017,"(as it is written, &ldquo;I have made you a father of many nations&rdquo; ) in the presence of Him whom he believed &ndash; God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;"
5478,4896,0,Rom,4018,"who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, &ldquo;So shall your descendants be.&rdquo; "
5479,4897,0,Rom,4019,"And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah&rsquo;s womb."
5480,4898,0,Rom,4020,"He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,"
5481,4899,0,Rom,4021,and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.
5482,4900,0,Rom,4022,"And therefore &ldquo;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo; "
5483,4901,0,Rom,4023,"Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him,"
5484,4902,0,Rom,4024,"but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,"
5485,4903,0,Rom,4025,"who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification."
5486,4904,0,Rom,5001,"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
5487,4905,0,Rom,5002,"through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
5488,4906,0,Rom,5003,"And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance;"
5489,4907,0,Rom,5004,"and perseverance, character; and character, hope."
5490,4908,0,Rom,5005,"Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us."
5491,4909,0,Rom,5006,"For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
5492,4910,0,Rom,5007,"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die."
5493,4911,0,Rom,5008,"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
5494,4912,0,Rom,5009,"Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him."
5495,4913,0,Rom,5010,"For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
5496,4914,0,Rom,5011,"And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."
5497,4915,0,Rom,5012,"Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned:"
5498,4916,0,Rom,5013,"For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
5499,4917,0,Rom,5014,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come."
5500,4918,0,Rom,5015,"But the free gift is not like the offense. For if by the one man&rsquo;s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many."
5501,4919,0,Rom,5016,"And the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned. For the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift which came from many offenses resulted in justification."
5502,4920,0,Rom,5017,"For if by the one man&rsquo;s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."
5503,4921,0,Rom,5018,"Therefore, as through one man&rsquo;s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man&rsquo;s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life."
5504,4922,0,Rom,5019,"For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man&rsquo;s obedience many will be made righteous."
5505,4923,0,Rom,5020,"Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more,"
5506,4924,0,Rom,5021,"so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
5507,4925,0,Rom,6001,What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
5508,4926,0,Rom,6002,Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
5509,4927,0,Rom,6003,Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
5510,4928,0,Rom,6004,"Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
5511,4929,0,Rom,6005,"For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection,"
5512,4930,0,Rom,6006,"knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin."
5513,4931,0,Rom,6007,For he who has died has been freed from sin.
5514,4932,0,Rom,6008,"Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,"
5515,4933,0,Rom,6009,"knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him."
5516,4934,0,Rom,6010,"For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God."
5517,4935,0,Rom,6011,"Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
5518,4936,0,Rom,6012,"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts."
5519,4937,0,Rom,6013,"And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God."
5520,4938,0,Rom,6014,"For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace."
5521,4939,0,Rom,6015,What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!
5522,4940,0,Rom,6016,"Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one&rsquo;s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?"
5523,4941,0,Rom,6017,"But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered."
5524,4942,0,Rom,6018,"And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness."
5525,4943,0,Rom,6019,"I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness."
5526,4944,0,Rom,6020,"For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness."
5527,4945,0,Rom,6021,What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
5528,4946,0,Rom,6022,"But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life."
5529,4947,0,Rom,6023,"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
5530,4948,0,Rom,7001,"Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?"
5531,4949,0,Rom,7002,"For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband."
5532,4950,0,Rom,7003,"So then if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man."
5533,4951,0,Rom,7004,"Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another &ndash; to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God."
5534,4952,0,Rom,7005,"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death."
5535,4953,0,Rom,7006,"But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter."
5536,4954,0,Rom,7007,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, &ldquo;You shall not covet.&rdquo; "
5537,4955,0,Rom,7008,"But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin was dead."
5538,4956,0,Rom,7009,"I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died."
5539,4957,0,Rom,7010,"And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death."
5540,4958,0,Rom,7011,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me."
5541,4959,0,Rom,7012,"Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good."
5542,4960,0,Rom,7013,"Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful."
5543,4961,0,Rom,7014,"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin."
5544,4962,0,Rom,7015,"For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do."
5545,4963,0,Rom,7016,"If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that it is good."
5546,4964,0,Rom,7017,"But now, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me."
5547,4965,0,Rom,7018,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find."
5548,4966,0,Rom,7019,"For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice."
5549,4967,0,Rom,7020,"Now if I do what I will not to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me."
5550,4968,0,Rom,7021,"I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good."
5551,4969,0,Rom,7022,For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man.
5552,4970,0,Rom,7023,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
5553,4971,0,Rom,7024,O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?
5554,4972,0,Rom,7025,"I thank God &ndash; through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin."
5555,4973,0,Rom,8001,"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
5556,4974,0,Rom,8002,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.
5557,4975,0,Rom,8003,"For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh,"
5558,4976,0,Rom,8004,that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
5559,4977,0,Rom,8005,"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit."
5560,4978,0,Rom,8006,"For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
5561,4979,0,Rom,8007,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be."
5562,4980,0,Rom,8008,"So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
5563,4981,0,Rom,8009,"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His."
5564,4982,0,Rom,8010,"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
5565,4983,0,Rom,8011,"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you."
5566,4984,0,Rom,8012,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors &ndash; not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh."
5567,4985,0,Rom,8013,"For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."
5568,4986,0,Rom,8014,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."
5569,4987,0,Rom,8015,"For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo;"
5570,4988,0,Rom,8016,"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,"
5571,4989,0,Rom,8017,"and if children, then heirs &ndash; heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together."
5572,4990,0,Rom,8018,For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
5573,4991,0,Rom,8019,For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.
5574,4992,0,Rom,8020,"For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope;"
5575,4993,0,Rom,8021,because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
5576,4994,0,Rom,8022,For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now.
5577,4995,0,Rom,8023,"Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body."
5578,4996,0,Rom,8024,"For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?"
5579,4997,0,Rom,8025,"But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance."
5580,4998,0,Rom,8026,"Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
5581,4999,0,Rom,8027,"Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
5582,5000,0,Rom,8028,"And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose."
5583,5001,0,Rom,8029,"For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren."
5584,5002,0,Rom,8030,"Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified."
5585,5003,0,Rom,8031,"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
5586,5004,0,Rom,8032,"He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?"
5587,5005,0,Rom,8033,"Who shall bring a charge against God&rsquo;s elect? It is God who justifies."
5588,5006,0,Rom,8034,"Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
5589,5007,0,Rom,8035,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
5590,5008,0,Rom,8036,"As it is written: &ldquo;For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.&rdquo; "
5591,5009,0,Rom,8037,Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
5592,5010,0,Rom,8038,"For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,"
5593,5011,0,Rom,8039,"nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
5594,5012,0,Rom,9001,"I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,"
5595,5013,0,Rom,9002,that I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart.
5596,5014,0,Rom,9003,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my countrymen according to the flesh,"
5597,5015,0,Rom,9004,"who are Israelites, to whom pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises;"
5598,5016,0,Rom,9005,"of whom are the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, the eternally blessed God. Amen."
5599,5017,0,Rom,9006,"But it is not that the word of God has taken no effect. For they are not all Israel who are of Israel,"
5600,5018,0,Rom,9007,"nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, &ldquo;In Isaac your seed shall be called.&rdquo; "
5601,5019,0,Rom,9008,"That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as the seed."
5602,5020,0,Rom,9009,"For this is the word of promise: &ldquo;At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.&rdquo; "
5603,5021,0,Rom,9010,"And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one man, even by our father Isaac"
5604,5022,0,Rom,9011,"(for the children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who calls),"

5606,5024,0,Rom,9013,"As it is written, &ldquo;Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.&rdquo; "
5607,5025,0,Rom,9014,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not!
5608,5026,0,Rom,9015,"For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.&rdquo; "
5609,5027,0,Rom,9016,"So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy."
5610,5028,0,Rom,9017,"For the Scripture says to the Pharaoh, &ldquo;For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth.&rdquo; "
5611,5029,0,Rom,9018,"Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens."
5612,5030,0,Rom,9019,"You will say to me then, &ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who has resisted His will?&rdquo;"
5613,5031,0,Rom,9020,"But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, &ldquo;Why have you made me like this?&rdquo;"

5615,5033,0,Rom,9022,"What if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,"
5616,5034,0,Rom,9023,"and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory,"
5617,5035,0,Rom,9024,"even us whom He called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
5618,5036,0,Rom,9025,"As He says also in Hosea: &ldquo;I will call them My people, who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved."

5620,5038,0,Rom,9027,"Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: &ldquo;Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant will be saved."

5622,5040,0,Rom,9029,"And as Isaiah said before: &ldquo;Unless the LORD of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.&rdquo; "
5623,5041,0,Rom,9030,"What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness of faith;"
5624,5042,0,Rom,9031,"but Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness. "
5625,5043,0,Rom,9032,"Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as it were, by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone."
5626,5044,0,Rom,9033,"As it is written: &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense, and whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.&rdquo; "

5630,5048,0,Rom,10004,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
5631,5049,0,Rom,10005,"For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, &ldquo;The man who does those things shall live by them.&rdquo; "

5674,5182,0,Rom,15023,"But now no longer having a place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,"
5675,5183,0,Rom,15024,"whenever I journey to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while."
5676,5184,0,Rom,15025,But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.
5677,5185,0,Rom,15026,For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem.
5678,5186,0,Rom,15027,"It pleased them indeed, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in material things."
5679,5187,0,Rom,15028,"Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain."
5680,5188,0,Rom,15029,"But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
5681,5189,0,Rom,15030,"Now I beg you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God for me,"
5682,5190,0,Rom,15031,"that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,"
5683,5191,0,Rom,15032,"that I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you."
5684,5192,0,Rom,15033,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
5685,5193,0,Rom,16001,"I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,"
5686,5194,0,Rom,16002,"that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever business she has need of you; for indeed she has been a helper of many and of myself also."
5687,5195,0,Rom,16003,"Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,"
5688,5196,0,Rom,16004,"who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
5689,5197,0,Rom,16005,"Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia to Christ."
5690,5198,0,Rom,16006,"Greet Mary, who labored much for us."
5691,5199,0,Rom,16007,"Greet Andronicus and Junia, my countrymen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
5692,5200,0,Rom,16008,"Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord."
5693,5201,0,Rom,16009,"Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved."
5694,5202,0,Rom,16010,"Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus."
5695,5203,0,Rom,16011,"Greet Herodion, my countryman. Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord."
5696,5204,0,Rom,16012,"Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who have labored in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord."
5697,5205,0,Rom,16013,"Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
5698,5206,0,Rom,16014,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them."
5699,5207,0,Rom,16015,"Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them."
5700,5208,0,Rom,16016,Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.
5701,5209,0,Rom,16017,"Now I urge you, brethren, note those who cause divisions and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and avoid them."
5702,5210,0,Rom,16018,"For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple."
5703,5211,0,Rom,16019,"For your obedience has become known to all. Therefore I am glad on your behalf; but I want you to be wise in what is good, and simple concerning evil."
5704,5212,0,Rom,16020,And the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
5705,5213,0,Rom,16021,"Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, greet you."
5706,5214,0,Rom,16022,"I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet you in the Lord."
5707,5215,0,Rom,16023,"Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, and Quartus, a brother."
5708,5216,0,Rom,16024,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
5709,5217,0,Rom,16025,"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret since the world began"
5710,5218,0,Rom,16026,"but now made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, for obedience to the faith &ndash; "
5711,5219,0,Rom,16027,"to God, alone wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen."
5712,5220,0,1Cor,1001,"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
5713,5221,0,1Cor,1002,"to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:"
5714,5222,0,1Cor,1003,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
5715,5223,0,1Cor,1004,"I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you by Christ Jesus,"
5716,5224,0,1Cor,1005,"that you were enriched in everything by Him in all utterance and all knowledge,"
5717,5225,0,1Cor,1006,"even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,"
5718,5226,0,1Cor,1007,"so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
5719,5227,0,1Cor,1008,"who will also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
5720,5228,0,1Cor,1009,"God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
5721,5229,0,1Cor,1010,"Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
5722,5230,0,1Cor,1011,"For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe&rsquo;s household, that there are contentions among you."
5723,5231,0,1Cor,1012,"Now I say this, that each of you says, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo;"
5724,5232,0,1Cor,1013,Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
5725,5233,0,1Cor,1014,"I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,"
5726,5234,0,1Cor,1015,lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.
5727,5235,0,1Cor,1016,"Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized any other."
5728,5236,0,1Cor,1017,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect."
5729,5237,0,1Cor,1018,"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
5730,5238,0,1Cor,1019,"For it is written: &ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.&rdquo;"
5731,5239,0,1Cor,1020,Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
5732,5240,0,1Cor,1021,"For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe."
5733,5241,0,1Cor,1022,"For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;"
5734,5242,0,1Cor,1023,"but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,"
5735,5243,0,1Cor,1024,"but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
5736,5244,0,1Cor,1025,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
5737,5245,0,1Cor,1026,"For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called."
5738,5246,0,1Cor,1027,"But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty;"
5739,5247,0,1Cor,1028,"and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,"
5740,5248,0,1Cor,1029,that no flesh should glory in His presence.
5741,5249,0,1Cor,1030,"But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God &ndash; and righteousness and sanctification and redemption &ndash; "
5742,5250,0,1Cor,1031,"that, as it is written, &ldquo;He who glories, let him glory in the LORD.&rdquo;"
5743,5251,0,1Cor,2001,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God."
5744,5252,0,1Cor,2002,For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
5745,5253,0,1Cor,2003,"I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling."
5746,5254,0,1Cor,2004,"And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"
5747,5255,0,1Cor,2005,that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
5748,5256,0,1Cor,2006,"However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing."
5749,5257,0,1Cor,2007,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages for our glory,"
5750,5258,0,1Cor,2008,"which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
5751,5259,0,1Cor,2009,"But, as it is written: &ldquo;What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love Him,&rdquo;"
5752,5260,0,1Cor,2010,"But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God."
5753,5261,0,1Cor,2011,For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
5754,5262,0,1Cor,2012,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God."
5755,5263,0,1Cor,2013,"These things we also speak, not in words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
5756,5264,0,1Cor,2014,"But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
5757,5265,0,1Cor,2015,"But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one."
5758,5266,0,1Cor,2016,"For &ldquo;who has known the mind of the LORD that he may instruct Him?&rdquo; But we have the mind of Christ."
5759,5267,0,1Cor,3001,"And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ."
5760,5268,0,1Cor,3002,"I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able;"
5761,5269,0,1Cor,3003,"for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men?"
5762,5270,0,1Cor,3004,"For when one says, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; are you not carnal?"
5763,5271,0,1Cor,3005,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one?"
5764,5272,0,1Cor,3006,"I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase."
5765,5273,0,1Cor,3007,"So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase."
5766,5274,0,1Cor,3008,"Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor."
5767,5275,0,1Cor,3009,"For we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s field, you are God&rsquo;s building."
5768,5276,0,1Cor,3010,"According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it."
5769,5277,0,1Cor,3011,"For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
5770,5278,0,1Cor,3012,"Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,"
5771,5279,0,1Cor,3013,"each one&rsquo;s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one&rsquo;s work, of what sort it is."
5772,5280,0,1Cor,3014,"If anyone&rsquo;s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward."
5773,5281,0,1Cor,3015,"If anyone&rsquo;s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire."
5774,5282,0,1Cor,3016,Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
5775,5283,0,1Cor,3017,"If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are."
5776,5284,0,1Cor,3018,"Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise."
5777,5285,0,1Cor,3019,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, &ldquo;He catches the wise in their own craftiness&rdquo;;"
5778,5286,0,1Cor,3020,"and again, &ldquo;The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.&rdquo;"
5779,5287,0,1Cor,3021,Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:
5780,5288,0,1Cor,3022,"whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come &ndash; all are yours."
5781,5289,0,1Cor,3023,"And you are Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is God&rsquo;s."
5782,5290,0,1Cor,4001,"Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God."
5783,5291,0,1Cor,4002,Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.
5784,5292,0,1Cor,4003,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself."
5785,5293,0,1Cor,4004,"For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord."
5786,5294,0,1Cor,4005,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each one&rsquo;s praise will come from God."
5787,5295,0,1Cor,4006,"Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one against the other."
5788,5296,0,1Cor,4007,"For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
5789,5297,0,1Cor,4008,"You are already full! You are already rich! You have reigned as kings without us &ndash; and indeed I could wish you did reign, that we also might reign with you!"
5790,5298,0,1Cor,4009,"For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we have been made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men."
5791,5299,0,1Cor,4010,"We are fools for Christ&rsquo;s sake, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!"
5792,5300,0,1Cor,4011,"To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and homeless."
5793,5301,0,1Cor,4012,"And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;"
5794,5302,0,1Cor,4013,"being defamed, we entreat. We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now."
5795,5303,0,1Cor,4014,"I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you."
5796,5304,0,1Cor,4015,"For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
5797,5305,0,1Cor,4016,"Therefore I urge you, imitate me."
5798,5306,0,1Cor,4017,"For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church."
5799,5307,0,1Cor,4018,"Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you."
5800,5308,0,1Cor,4019,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power."
5801,5309,0,1Cor,4020,For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.
5802,5310,0,1Cor,4021,"What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"
5803,5311,0,1Cor,5001,"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles &ndash; that a man has his father&rsquo;s wife!"
5804,5312,0,1Cor,5002,"And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you."
5805,5313,0,1Cor,5003,"For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed."
5806,5314,0,1Cor,5004,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
5807,5315,0,1Cor,5005,"deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
5808,5316,0,1Cor,5006,Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
5809,5317,0,1Cor,5007,"Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us."
5810,5318,0,1Cor,5008,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
5811,5319,0,1Cor,5009,I wrote to you in my epistle not to keep company with sexually immoral people.
5812,5320,0,1Cor,5010,"Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world."
5813,5321,0,1Cor,5011,"But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner &ndash; not even to eat with such a person."
5814,5322,0,1Cor,5012,For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?
5815,5323,0,1Cor,5013,"But those who are outside God judges. Therefore &ldquo;put away from yourselves the evil person.&rdquo;"
5816,5324,0,1Cor,6001,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"
5817,5325,0,1Cor,6002,"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
5818,5326,0,1Cor,6003,"Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?"
5819,5327,0,1Cor,6004,"If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge?"
5820,5328,0,1Cor,6005,"I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?"
5821,5407,0,1Cor,9011,"If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it a great thing if we reap your material things?"
5822,5408,0,1Cor,9012,"If others are partakers of this right over you, are we not even more? Nevertheless we have not used this right, but endure all things lest we hinder the gospel of Christ."
5823,5409,0,1Cor,9013,"Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of the offerings of the altar?"
5824,5410,0,1Cor,9014,Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.
5825,5411,0,1Cor,9015,"But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me; for it would be better for me to die than that anyone should make my boasting void."
5826,5412,0,1Cor,9016,"For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!"
5827,5413,0,1Cor,9017,"For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship."
5828,5414,0,1Cor,9018,"What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel."
5829,5415,0,1Cor,9019,"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more;"
5830,5416,0,1Cor,9020,"and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law;"
5831,5417,0,1Cor,9021,"to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law;"
5832,5418,0,1Cor,9022,"to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
5833,5419,0,1Cor,9023,"Now this I do for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, that I may be partaker of it with you."
5834,5420,0,1Cor,9024,"Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it."
5835,5421,0,1Cor,9025,"And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown."
5836,5422,0,1Cor,9026,Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air.
5837,5423,0,1Cor,9027,"But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified."
5838,5424,0,1Cor,10001,"Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the cloud, all passed through the sea,"
5839,5425,0,1Cor,10002,"all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,"
5840,5426,0,1Cor,10003,"all ate the same spiritual food,"
5841,5427,0,1Cor,10004,"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ."
5842,5428,0,1Cor,10005,"But with most of them God was not well pleased, for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness."
5843,5429,0,1Cor,10006,"Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted."
5844,5430,0,1Cor,10007,"And do not become idolaters as were some of them. As it is written, &ldquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.&rdquo;"
5845,5431,0,1Cor,10008,"Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell;"
5846,5432,0,1Cor,10009,"nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents;"
5847,5433,0,1Cor,10010,"nor complain, as some of them also complained, and were destroyed by the destroyer."
5848,5434,0,1Cor,10011,"Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come."
5849,5435,0,1Cor,10012,Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
5850,5436,0,1Cor,10013,"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it."
5851,5437,0,1Cor,10014,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
5852,5438,0,1Cor,10015,"I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say."
5853,5439,0,1Cor,10016,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
5854,5440,0,1Cor,10017,"For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread."
5855,5441,0,1Cor,10018,Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
5856,5442,0,1Cor,10019,"What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?"
5857,5443,0,1Cor,10020,"Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons."
5858,5444,0,1Cor,10021,"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table and of the table of demons."
5859,5445,0,1Cor,10022,Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
5860,5446,0,1Cor,10023,"All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify."
5861,5447,0,1Cor,10024,"Let no one seek his own, but each one the other&rsquo;s well-being."
5862,5448,0,1Cor,10025,"Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience&rsquo; sake;"
5863,5449,0,1Cor,10026,"for &ldquo;the earth is the LORD&rsquo;s, and all its fullness.&rdquo;"
5864,5450,0,1Cor,10027,"If any of those who do not believe invites you to dinner, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience&rsquo; sake."
5865,5451,0,1Cor,10028,"But if anyone says to you, &ldquo;This was offered to idols,&rdquo; do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for conscience&rsquo; sake; for &ldquo;the earth is the LORD&rsquo;s, and all its fullness.&rdquo;"
5866,5452,0,1Cor,10029,"Conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty judged by another man&rsquo;s conscience?"
5867,5453,0,1Cor,10030,"But if I partake with thanks, why am I evil spoken of for the food over which I give thanks?"
5868,5454,0,1Cor,10031,"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
5869,5455,0,1Cor,10032,"Give no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God,"
5870,5456,0,1Cor,10033,"just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
5871,5457,0,1Cor,11001,"Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ. (2) Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you."
5872,5458,0,1Cor,11003,"But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God."
5873,5459,0,1Cor,11004,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."
5874,5460,0,1Cor,11005,"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved."
5875,5461,0,1Cor,11006,"For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered."
5876,5462,0,1Cor,11007,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man."
5877,5463,0,1Cor,11008,"For man is not from woman, but woman from man."
5878,5464,0,1Cor,11009,"Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man."
5879,5465,0,1Cor,11010,"For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels."
5880,5466,0,1Cor,11011,"Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord."
5881,5467,0,1Cor,11012,"For as woman came from man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God."
5882,5468,0,1Cor,11013,Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
5883,5469,0,1Cor,11014,"Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?"
5884,5470,0,1Cor,11015,"But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering."
5885,5471,0,1Cor,11016,"But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God."
5886,5472,0,1Cor,11017,"Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse."
5887,5473,0,1Cor,11018,"For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it."
5888,5474,0,1Cor,11019,"For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you."
5889,5475,0,1Cor,11020,"Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord&rsquo;s Supper."
5890,5476,0,1Cor,11021,"For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk."
5891,5477,0,1Cor,11022,What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.
5892,5478,0,1Cor,11023,"For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;"
5893,5479,0,1Cor,11024,"and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;"
5894,5480,0,1Cor,11025,"In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;"
5895,5481,0,1Cor,11026,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death till He comes."
5896,5482,0,1Cor,11027,Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
5897,5483,0,1Cor,11028,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
5898,5648,0,1Cor,16017,"I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied."
5899,5649,0,1Cor,16018,For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.
5900,5650,0,1Cor,16019,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
5901,5651,0,1Cor,16020,All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
5902,5652,0,1Cor,16021,"The salutation with my own hand &ndash; Paul&rsquo;s."
5903,5653,0,1Cor,16022,"If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. O Lord, come!"
5904,5654,0,1Cor,16023,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
5905,5655,0,1Cor,16024,My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
5906,5656,0,2Cor,1001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:"
5907,5657,0,2Cor,1002,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
5908,5658,0,2Cor,1003,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,"
5909,5659,0,2Cor,1004,"who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God."
5910,5660,0,2Cor,1005,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ."
5911,5661,0,2Cor,1006,"Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
5912,5662,0,2Cor,1007,"And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation."
5913,5663,0,2Cor,1008,"For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life."
5914,5664,0,2Cor,1009,"Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,"
5915,5665,0,2Cor,1010,"who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver us,"
5916,5666,0,2Cor,1011,"you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift granted to us through many."
5917,5667,0,2Cor,1012,"For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you."
5918,5668,0,2Cor,1013,"For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end"
5919,5669,0,2Cor,1014,"(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus."
5920,5670,0,2Cor,1015,"And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit &ndash; "
5921,5671,0,2Cor,1016,"to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea."
5922,5672,0,2Cor,1017,"Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No?"
5923,5673,0,2Cor,1018,"But as God is faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No."
5924,5674,0,2Cor,1019,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us &ndash; by me, Silvanus, and Timothy &ndash; was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes."
5925,5675,0,2Cor,1020,"For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us."
5926,5676,0,2Cor,1021,"Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,"
5927,5677,0,2Cor,1022,who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
5928,5678,0,2Cor,1023,"Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth."
5929,5679,0,2Cor,1024,"Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand."
5930,5680,0,2Cor,2001,"But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow."
5931,5681,0,2Cor,2002,"For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?"
5932,5682,0,2Cor,2003,"And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all."
5933,5683,0,2Cor,2004,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you."
5934,5684,0,2Cor,2005,"But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent &ndash; not to be too severe."
5935,5685,0,2Cor,2006,"This punishment which was inflicted by the majority is sufficient for such a man,"
5936,5686,0,2Cor,2007,"so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow."
5937,5687,0,2Cor,2008,Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him.
5938,5688,0,2Cor,2009,"For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things."
5939,5689,0,2Cor,2010,"Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,"
5940,5690,0,2Cor,2011,"lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices."
5941,5691,0,2Cor,2012,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ&rsquo;s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,"
5942,5692,0,2Cor,2013,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia."
5943,5693,0,2Cor,2014,"Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place."
5944,5694,0,2Cor,2015,For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
5945,5695,0,2Cor,2016,"To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things?"
5946,5696,0,2Cor,2017,"For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ."
5947,5697,0,2Cor,3001,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some others, epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you?"
5948,5698,0,2Cor,3002,"You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men;"
5949,5699,0,2Cor,3003,"clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart."
5950,5700,0,2Cor,3004,And we have such trust through Christ toward God.
5951,5701,0,2Cor,3005,"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,"
5952,5702,0,2Cor,3006,"who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
5953,5703,0,2Cor,3007,"But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away,"
5954,5704,0,2Cor,3008,how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?
5955,5705,0,2Cor,3009,"For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory."
5956,5706,0,2Cor,3010,"For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels."
5957,5707,0,2Cor,3011,"For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious."
5958,5708,0,2Cor,3012,"Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech &ndash; "
5959,5709,0,2Cor,3013,"unlike Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away."
5960,5710,0,2Cor,3014,"But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is taken away in Christ."
5961,5711,0,2Cor,3015,"But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart."
5962,5712,0,2Cor,3016,"Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
5963,5713,0,2Cor,3017,"Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
5964,5714,0,2Cor,3018,"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord."
5965,5715,0,2Cor,4001,"Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart."
5966,5716,0,2Cor,4002,"But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man&rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God."
5967,5717,0,2Cor,4003,"But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,"
5968,5718,0,2Cor,4004,"whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them."
5969,5719,0,2Cor,4005,"For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus&rsquo; sake."
5970,5720,0,2Cor,4006,"For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
5971,5721,0,2Cor,4007,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."
5972,5722,0,2Cor,4008,"We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
5973,5723,0,2Cor,4009,"persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed &ndash; "
5974,5724,0,2Cor,4010,"always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
5975,5725,0,2Cor,4011,"For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."
5976,5726,0,2Cor,4012,"So then death is working in us, but life in you."
5977,5727,0,2Cor,4013,"And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, &ldquo;I believed and therefore I spoke,&rdquo; we also believe and therefore speak,"
5978,5728,0,2Cor,4014,"knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you."
5979,5729,0,2Cor,4015,"For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God."
5980,5730,0,2Cor,4016,"Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day."
5981,5731,0,2Cor,4017,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,"
5982,5732,0,2Cor,4018,"while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
5983,5733,0,2Cor,5001,"For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
5984,5734,0,2Cor,5002,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven,"
5985,5735,0,2Cor,5003,"if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked."
5986,5736,0,2Cor,5004,"For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life."
5987,5737,0,2Cor,5005,"Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee."
5988,5738,0,2Cor,5006,"So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord."
5989,5739,0,2Cor,5007,"For we walk by faith, not by sight."
5990,5740,0,2Cor,5008,"We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord."
5991,5741,0,2Cor,5009,"Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him."
5992,5742,0,2Cor,5010,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
5993,5743,0,2Cor,5011,"Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences."
5994,5744,0,2Cor,5012,"For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart."
5995,5745,0,2Cor,5013,"For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you."
5996,5746,0,2Cor,5014,"For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died;"
5997,5747,0,2Cor,5015,"and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again."
5998,5748,0,2Cor,5016,"Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer."
5999,5749,0,2Cor,5017,"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new."
6000,5750,0,2Cor,5018,"Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,"
6001,5751,0,2Cor,5019,"that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation."
6002,5752,0,2Cor,5020,"Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ&rsquo;s behalf, be reconciled to God."
6003,5753,0,2Cor,5021,"For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
6004,5754,0,2Cor,6001,"We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain."
6005,5755,0,2Cor,6002,"For He says: &ldquo;In an acceptable time I have heard You, and in the day of salvation I have helped You.&rdquo; Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."
6006,5756,0,2Cor,6003,"We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed."
6007,5757,0,2Cor,6004,"But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses,"
6008,5758,0,2Cor,6005,"in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings;"
6009,5759,0,2Cor,6006,"by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,"
6010,5760,0,2Cor,6007,"by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
6011,5761,0,2Cor,6008,"by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;"
6012,5762,0,2Cor,6009,"as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not killed;"
6013,5763,0,2Cor,6010,"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
6014,5764,0,2Cor,6011,"O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open."
6015,5765,0,2Cor,6012,"You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections."
6016,5766,0,2Cor,6013,"Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open."
6017,5767,0,2Cor,6014,Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?
6018,5768,0,2Cor,6015,And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?
6019,5769,0,2Cor,6016,"And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: &ldquo;I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they shall be My people.&rdquo;"
6020,5770,0,2Cor,6017,"Therefore &ldquo;Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you.&rdquo;"
6021,5771,0,2Cor,6018,"&ldquo;I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the LORD Almighty.&rdquo;"
6022,5772,0,2Cor,7001,"Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
6023,5773,0,2Cor,7002,"Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have cheated no one."
6024,5774,0,2Cor,7003,"I do not say this to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together."
6025,5775,0,2Cor,7004,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation."
6026,5776,0,2Cor,7005,"For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside were conflicts, inside were fears."
6027,5777,0,2Cor,7006,"Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,"
6028,5778,0,2Cor,7007,"and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more."
6029,5779,0,2Cor,7008,"For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while."
6030,5780,0,2Cor,7009,"Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing."
6031,5781,0,2Cor,7010,"For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death."
6032,5782,0,2Cor,7011,"For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
6033,5783,0,2Cor,7012,"Therefore, although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you."
6034,5784,0,2Cor,7013,"Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all."
6035,5785,0,2Cor,7014,"For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true."
6036,5786,0,2Cor,7015,"And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him."
6037,5787,0,2Cor,7016,Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.
6038,5788,0,2Cor,8001,"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:"
6039,5789,0,2Cor,8002,that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality.
6040,5790,0,2Cor,8003,"For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing,"
6041,5791,0,2Cor,8004,imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
6042,5792,0,2Cor,8005,"And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God."
6043,5793,0,2Cor,8006,"So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well."
6044,5794,0,2Cor,8007,"But as you abound in everything &ndash; in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us &ndash; see that you abound in this grace also."
6045,5795,0,2Cor,8008,"I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others."
6046,5796,0,2Cor,8009,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich."
6047,5797,0,2Cor,8010,"And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago;"
6048,5798,0,2Cor,8011,"but now you also must complete the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to desire it, so there also may be a completion out of what you have."
6049,5799,0,2Cor,8012,"For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have."
6050,5800,0,2Cor,8013,"For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;"
6051,5801,0,2Cor,8014,"but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack &ndash; that there may be equality."
6052,5802,0,2Cor,8015,"As it is written, &ldquo;He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.&rdquo;"
6053,5803,0,2Cor,8016,But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
6054,5804,0,2Cor,8017,"For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord."
6055,5805,0,2Cor,8018,"And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,"
6056,5806,0,2Cor,8019,"and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and to show your ready mind,"
6057,5807,0,2Cor,8020,"avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us &ndash; "
6058,5808,0,2Cor,8021,"providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
6059,5809,0,2Cor,8022,"And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which we have in you."
6060,5810,0,2Cor,8023,"If anyone inquires about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker concerning you. Or if our brethren are inquired about, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ."
6061,5811,0,2Cor,8024,"Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf."
6062,5812,0,2Cor,9001,"Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;"
6063,5813,0,2Cor,9002,"for I know your willingness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority."
6064,5814,0,2Cor,9003,"Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready;"
6065,5815,0,2Cor,9004,"lest if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed of this confident boasting."
6066,5816,0,2Cor,9005,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which you had previously promised, that it may be ready as a matter of generosity and not as a grudging obligation."
6067,5817,0,2Cor,9006,"But this I say: &ldquo;He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.&rdquo;"
6068,5818,0,2Cor,9007,"So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver."
6069,5819,0,2Cor,9008,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work."
6070,5820,0,2Cor,9009,"As it is written: &ldquo;He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.&rdquo;"
6071,5821,0,2Cor,9010,"Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness,"
6072,5822,0,2Cor,9011,"while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God."
6073,5823,0,2Cor,9012,"For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,"
6074,5824,0,2Cor,9013,"while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men,"
6075,5825,0,2Cor,9014,"and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding grace of God in you."
6076,5826,0,2Cor,9015,Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
6077,5827,0,2Cor,10001,"Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ &ndash; who in presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you."
6078,5828,0,2Cor,10002,"But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
6079,5829,0,2Cor,10003,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh."
6080,5830,0,2Cor,10004,"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,"
6081,5831,0,2Cor,10005,"casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,"
6082,5832,0,2Cor,10006,and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.
6083,5833,0,2Cor,10007,"Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christ&rsquo;s, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christ&rsquo;s, even so we are Christ&rsquo;s."
6084,5834,0,2Cor,10008,"For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed &ndash; "
6085,5835,0,2Cor,10009,lest I seem to terrify you by letters.
6086,5836,0,2Cor,10010,"For his letters, they say, &ldquo;are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.&rdquo;"
6087,5837,0,2Cor,10011,"Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such we will also be in deed when we are present."
6088,5838,0,2Cor,10012,"For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
6089,5839,0,2Cor,10013,"We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us &ndash; a sphere which especially includes you."
6090,5840,0,2Cor,10014,"For we are not overextending ourselves (as though our authority did not extend to you), for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ;"
6091,5841,0,2Cor,10015,"not boasting of things beyond measure, that is, in other men&rsquo;s labors, but having hope, that as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you in our sphere,"
6092,5842,0,2Cor,10016,"to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man&rsquo;s sphere of accomplishment."
6093,5843,0,2Cor,10017,"But &ldquo;he who glories, let him glory in the LORD.&rdquo;"
6094,5844,0,2Cor,10018,"For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends."
6095,5845,0,2Cor,11001,"Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly &ndash; and indeed you do bear with me."
6096,5846,0,2Cor,11002,"For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
6097,5847,0,2Cor,11003,"But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
6098,5848,0,2Cor,11004,"For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted &ndash; you may well put up with it!"
6099,5849,0,2Cor,11005,For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles.
6100,5850,0,2Cor,11006,"Even though I am untrained in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. But we have been thoroughly manifested among you in all things."
6101,5851,0,2Cor,11007,"Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?"
6102,5852,0,2Cor,11008,"I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to minister to you."
6103,5853,0,2Cor,11009,"And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself."
6104,5854,0,2Cor,11010,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
6105,5855,0,2Cor,11011,Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!
6106,5856,0,2Cor,11012,"But what I do, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast."
6107,5857,0,2Cor,11013,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ."
6108,5858,0,2Cor,11014,And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.
6109,5859,0,2Cor,11015,"Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works."
6110,5860,0,2Cor,11016,"I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little."
6111,5861,0,2Cor,11017,"What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
6112,5862,0,2Cor,11018,"Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast."
6113,5863,0,2Cor,11019,"For you put up with fools gladly, since you yourselves are wise!"
6114,5864,0,2Cor,11020,"For you put up with it if one brings you into bondage, if one devours you, if one takes from you, if one exalts himself, if one strikes you on the face."
6115,5865,0,2Cor,11021,"To our shame I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone is bold &ndash; I speak foolishly &ndash; I am bold also."
6116,5866,0,2Cor,11022,Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.
6117,5867,0,2Cor,11023,"Are they ministers of Christ? &ndash; I speak as a fool &ndash; I am more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often."
6118,5868,0,2Cor,11024,From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.
6119,5869,0,2Cor,11025,"Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
6120,5870,0,2Cor,11026,"in journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
6121,5871,0,2Cor,11027,"in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness &ndash; "
6122,5872,0,2Cor,11028,"besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for all the churches."
6123,5873,0,2Cor,11029,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?"
6124,5874,0,2Cor,11030,"If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity."
6125,5875,0,2Cor,11031,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying."
6126,5876,0,2Cor,11032,"In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me;"
6127,5877,0,2Cor,11033,"but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands."
6128,5878,0,2Cor,12001,It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:
6129,5879,0,2Cor,12002,"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago &ndash; whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows &ndash; such a one was caught up to the third heaven."
6130,5880,0,2Cor,12003,"And I know such a man &ndash; whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows &ndash; "
6131,5881,0,2Cor,12004,"how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
6132,5882,0,2Cor,12005,"Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities."
6133,5883,0,2Cor,12006,"For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me."
6134,5884,0,2Cor,12007,"And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure."
6135,5885,0,2Cor,12008,Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
6136,5886,0,2Cor,12009,"And He said to me, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&rdquo; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
6137,5887,0,2Cor,12010,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ&rsquo;s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
6138,5888,0,2Cor,12011,"I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing."
6139,5889,0,2Cor,12012,"Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds."
6140,5890,0,2Cor,12013,"For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!"
6141,5891,0,2Cor,12014,"Now for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
6142,5892,0,2Cor,12015,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved."
6143,5893,0,2Cor,12016,"But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning!"
6144,5894,0,2Cor,12017,Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
6145,5895,0,2Cor,12018,"I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?"
6146,5896,0,2Cor,12019,"Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification."
6147,5897,0,2Cor,12020,"For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults;"
6148,5898,0,2Cor,12021,"lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced."
6149,5899,0,2Cor,13001,"This will be the third time I am coming to you. &ldquo;By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.&rdquo;"
6150,5900,0,2Cor,13002,"I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare &ndash; "
6151,5901,0,2Cor,13003,"since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you."
6152,5902,0,2Cor,13004,"For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you."
6153,5903,0,2Cor,13005,"Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? &ndash; unless indeed you are disqualified."
6154,5904,0,2Cor,13006,But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.
6155,5905,0,2Cor,13007,"Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you should do what is honorable, though we may seem disqualified."
6156,5906,0,2Cor,13008,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
6157,5907,0,2Cor,13009,"For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete."
6158,5908,0,2Cor,13010,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification and not for destruction."
6159,5909,0,2Cor,13011,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you."
6160,5910,0,2Cor,13012,Greet one another with a holy kiss.
6161,5911,0,2Cor,13013,All the saints greet you.
6162,5912,0,2Cor,13014,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen."
6163,5913,0,Gal,1001,"Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),"
6164,5914,0,Gal,1002,"and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:"
6165,5915,0,Gal,1003,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
6166,5916,0,Gal,1004,"who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"
6167,5917,0,Gal,1005,to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
6168,5918,0,Gal,1006,"I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,"
6169,5919,0,Gal,1007,"which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ."
6170,5920,0,Gal,1008,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed."
6171,5921,0,Gal,1009,"As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed."
6172,5922,0,Gal,1010,"For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
6173,5923,0,Gal,1011,"But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man."
6174,5924,0,Gal,1012,"For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ."
6175,5925,0,Gal,1013,"For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it."
6176,5926,0,Gal,1014,"And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers."
6177,5927,0,Gal,1015,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&rsquo;s womb and called me through His grace,"
6178,5928,0,Gal,1016,"to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,"
6179,5929,0,Gal,1017,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus."
6180,5930,0,Gal,1018,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days."
6181,5931,0,Gal,1019,"But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother."
6182,5932,0,Gal,1020,"(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)"
6183,5933,0,Gal,1021,Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
6184,5934,0,Gal,1022,And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.
6185,5935,0,Gal,1023,"But they were hearing only, &ldquo;He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.&rdquo;"
6186,5936,0,Gal,1024,And they glorified God in me.
6187,5937,0,Gal,2001,"Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with me."
6188,5938,0,Gal,2002,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain."
6189,5939,0,Gal,2003,"Yet not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
6190,5940,0,Gal,2004,"And this occurred because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage),"
6191,5941,0,Gal,2005,"to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
6192,5942,0,Gal,2006,"But from those who seemed to be something &ndash; whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal favoritism to no man &ndash; for those who seemed to be something added nothing to me."
6193,5943,0,Gal,2007,"But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as the gospel for the circumcised was to Peter"
6194,5944,0,Gal,2008,"(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles),"
6195,5945,0,Gal,2009,"and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
6196,5946,0,Gal,2010,"They desired only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do."
6197,5947,0,Gal,2011,"Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed;"
6198,5948,0,Gal,2012,"for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision."
6199,5949,0,Gal,2013,"And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy."
6200,5950,0,Gal,2014,"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, &ldquo;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews?"
6201,5951,0,Gal,2015,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
6202,5952,0,Gal,2016,"knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified."
6203,5953,0,Gal,2017,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not!"
6204,5954,0,Gal,2018,"For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
6205,5955,0,Gal,2019,For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God.
6206,5956,0,Gal,2020,"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
6207,5957,0,Gal,2021,"I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.&rdquo;"
6208,5958,0,Gal,3001,"O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?"
6209,5959,0,Gal,3002,"This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
6210,5960,0,Gal,3003,"Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?"
6211,5961,0,Gal,3004,"Have you suffered so many things in vain &ndash; if indeed it was in vain?"
6212,5962,0,Gal,3005,"Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? &ndash; "
6213,5963,0,Gal,3006,"just as Abraham &ldquo;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo;"
6214,5964,0,Gal,3007,Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.
6215,5965,0,Gal,3008,"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, &ldquo;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&rdquo;"
6216,5966,0,Gal,3009,So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
6217,5967,0,Gal,3010,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, &ldquo;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&rdquo;"
6218,5968,0,Gal,3011,"But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for &ldquo;the just shall live by faith.&rdquo;"
6219,5969,0,Gal,3012,"Yet the law is not of faith, but &ldquo;the man who does them shall live by them.&rdquo;"
6220,5970,0,Gal,3013,"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, &ldquo;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree&rdquo;),"
6221,5971,0,Gal,3014,"that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
6222,5972,0,Gal,3015,"Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a man&rsquo;s covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it."
6223,5973,0,Gal,3016,"Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &ldquo;And to seeds,&rdquo; as of many, but as of one, &ldquo;And to your Seed,&rdquo; who is Christ."
6224,5974,0,Gal,3017,"And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect."
6225,5975,0,Gal,3018,"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
6226,5976,0,Gal,3019,"What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator."
6227,5977,0,Gal,3020,"Now a mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one."
6228,5978,0,Gal,3021,"Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law."
6229,5979,0,Gal,3022,"But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
6230,5980,0,Gal,3023,"But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed."
6231,5981,0,Gal,3024,"Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
6232,5982,0,Gal,3025,"But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
6233,5983,0,Gal,3026,For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
6234,5984,0,Gal,3027,For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
6235,5985,0,Gal,3028,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
6236,5986,0,Gal,3029,"And if you are Christ&rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and heirs according to the promise."
6237,5987,0,Gal,4001,"Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,"
6238,5988,0,Gal,4002,but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
6239,5989,0,Gal,4003,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world."
6240,5990,0,Gal,4004,"But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
6241,5991,0,Gal,4005,"to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons."
6242,5992,0,Gal,4006,"And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo;"
6243,5993,0,Gal,4007,"Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
6244,5994,0,Gal,4008,"But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods."
6245,5995,0,Gal,4009,"But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?"
6246,5996,0,Gal,4010,You observe days and months and seasons and years.
6247,5997,0,Gal,4011,"I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain."
6248,5998,0,Gal,4012,"Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all."
6249,5999,0,Gal,4013,You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first.
6250,6000,0,Gal,4014,"And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
6251,6001,0,Gal,4015,"What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me."
6252,6002,0,Gal,4016,Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
6253,6003,0,Gal,4017,"They zealously court you, but for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them."
6254,6004,0,Gal,4018,"But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you."
6255,6005,0,Gal,4019,"My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you,"
6256,6006,0,Gal,4020,"I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you."
6257,6007,0,Gal,4021,"Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?"
6258,6008,0,Gal,4022,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman."
6259,6009,0,Gal,4023,"But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise,"
6260,6010,0,Gal,4024,"which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar &ndash; "
6261,6011,0,Gal,4025,"for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children &ndash; "
6262,6012,0,Gal,4026,"but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all."
6263,6013,0,Gal,4027,"For it is written: &ldquo;Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband.&rdquo;"
6264,6014,0,Gal,4028,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise."
6265,6015,0,Gal,4029,"But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now."
6266,6016,0,Gal,4030,"Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&rdquo;"
6267,6017,0,Gal,4031,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free."
6268,6018,0,Gal,5001,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage."
6269,6019,0,Gal,5002,"Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing."
6270,6020,0,Gal,5003,And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.
6271,6021,0,Gal,5004,"You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace."
6272,6022,0,Gal,5005,For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
6273,6023,0,Gal,5006,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love."
6274,6024,0,Gal,5007,You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
6275,6025,0,Gal,5008,This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.
6276,6026,0,Gal,5009,A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
6277,6027,0,Gal,5010,"I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is."
6278,6028,0,Gal,5011,"And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased."
6279,6029,0,Gal,5012,I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!
6280,6030,0,Gal,5013,"For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another."
6281,6031,0,Gal,5014,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;"
6282,6032,0,Gal,5015,"But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!"
6283,6033,0,Gal,5016,"I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
6284,6034,0,Gal,5017,"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish."
6285,6035,0,Gal,5018,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
6286,6036,0,Gal,5019,"Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness,"
6287,6037,0,Gal,5020,"idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,"
6288,6038,0,Gal,5021,"envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
6289,6039,0,Gal,5022,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,"
6290,6040,0,Gal,5023,"gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law."
6291,6041,0,Gal,5024,"And those who are Christ&rsquo;s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
6292,6042,0,Gal,5025,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
6293,6043,0,Gal,5026,"Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
6294,6044,0,Gal,6001,"Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted."
6295,6045,0,Gal,6002,"Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
6296,6046,0,Gal,6003,"For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
6297,6047,0,Gal,6004,"But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
6298,6133,0,Eph,4006,"one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
6299,6134,0,Eph,4007,"But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ&rsquo;s gift."
6300,6135,0,Eph,4008,"Therefore He says: &ldquo;When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.&rdquo;"
6301,6136,0,Eph,4009,"(Now this, &ldquo;He ascended&rdquo; &ndash; what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
6302,6137,0,Eph,4010,"He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)"
6303,6138,0,Eph,4011,"And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,"
6304,6139,0,Eph,4012,"for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,"
6305,6140,0,Eph,4013,"till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;"
6306,6141,0,Eph,4014,"that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,"
6307,6142,0,Eph,4015,"but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head &ndash; Christ &ndash; "
6308,6143,0,Eph,4016,"from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love."
6309,6144,0,Eph,4017,"This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind,"
6310,6145,0,Eph,4018,"having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;"
6311,6146,0,Eph,4019,"who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
6312,6147,0,Eph,4020,"But you have not so learned Christ,"
6313,6148,0,Eph,4021,"if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
6314,6149,0,Eph,4022,"that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,"
6315,6150,0,Eph,4023,"and be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
6316,6151,0,Eph,4024,"and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness."
6317,6152,0,Eph,4025,"Therefore, putting away lying, &ldquo;Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,&rdquo; for we are members of one another."
6318,6153,0,Eph,4026,"Be angry, and do not sin: do not let the sun go down on your wrath,"
6319,6154,0,Eph,4027,nor give place to the devil.
6320,6155,0,Eph,4028,"Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need."
6321,6156,0,Eph,4029,"Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers."
6322,6157,0,Eph,4030,"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
6323,6158,0,Eph,4031,"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice."
6324,6159,0,Eph,4032,"And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you."
6325,6160,0,Eph,5001,Therefore be imitators of God as dear children.
6326,6161,0,Eph,5002,"And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma."
6327,6162,0,Eph,5003,"But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints;"
6328,6163,0,Eph,5004,"neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks."
6329,6164,0,Eph,5005,"For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
6330,6165,0,Eph,5006,"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."
6331,6166,0,Eph,5007,Therefore do not be partakers with them.
6332,6167,0,Eph,5008,"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light"
6333,6168,0,Eph,5009,"(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),"
6334,6169,0,Eph,5010,finding out what is acceptable to the Lord.
6335,6170,0,Eph,5011,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them."
6336,6171,0,Eph,5012,For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.
6337,6172,0,Eph,5013,"But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light."
6338,6173,0,Eph,5014,"Therefore He says: &ldquo;Awake, you who sleep, arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light.&rdquo;"
6339,6174,0,Eph,5015,"See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise,"
6340,6175,0,Eph,5016,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
6341,6176,0,Eph,5017,"Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
6342,6177,0,Eph,5018,"And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,"
6343,6178,0,Eph,5019,"speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,"
6344,6179,0,Eph,5020,"giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
6345,6180,0,Eph,5021,submitting to one another in the fear of God.
6346,6181,0,Eph,5022,"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord."
6347,6182,0,Eph,5023,"For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body."
6348,6183,0,Eph,5024,"Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything."
6349,6184,0,Eph,5025,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,"
6350,6185,0,Eph,5026,"that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word,"
6351,6186,0,Eph,5027,"that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish."
6352,6187,0,Eph,5028,"So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself."
6353,6188,0,Eph,5029,"For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church."
6354,6189,0,Eph,5030,"For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones."
6355,6190,0,Eph,5031,"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."
6356,6191,0,Eph,5032,"This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
6357,6192,0,Eph,5033,"Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband."
6358,6193,0,Eph,6001,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
6359,6194,0,Eph,6002,"Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise:"
6360,6195,0,Eph,6003,that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.
6361,6196,0,Eph,6004,"And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord."
6362,6197,0,Eph,6005,"Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;"
6363,6198,0,Eph,6006,"not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,"
6364,6199,0,Eph,6007,"with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men,"
6365,6200,0,Eph,6008,"knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free."
6366,6201,0,Eph,6009,"And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him."
6367,6202,0,Eph,6010,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might."
6368,6203,0,Eph,6011,"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
6369,6204,0,Eph,6012,"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."
6370,6205,0,Eph,6013,"Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
6371,6206,0,Eph,6014,"Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness,"
6372,6207,0,Eph,6015,"and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
6373,6208,0,Eph,6016,"above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one."
6374,6209,0,Eph,6017,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;"
6375,6210,0,Eph,6018,"praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints &ndash; "
6376,6211,0,Eph,6019,"and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
6377,6212,0,Eph,6020,"for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
6378,6213,0,Eph,6021,"But that you also may know my affairs and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you;"
6379,6214,0,Eph,6022,"whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our affairs, and that he may comfort your hearts."
6380,6215,0,Eph,6023,"Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
6381,6216,0,Eph,6024,Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
6382,6217,0,Phil,1001,"Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
6383,6218,0,Phil,1002,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
6384,6219,0,Phil,1003,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
6385,6220,0,Phil,1004,"always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy,"
6386,6221,0,Phil,1005,"for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,"
6387,6222,0,Phil,1006,"being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;"
6388,6223,0,Phil,1007,"just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace."
6389,6224,0,Phil,1008,"For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ."
6390,6225,0,Phil,1009,"And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,"
6391,6226,0,Phil,1010,"that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ,"
6392,6227,0,Phil,1011,"being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God."
6393,6228,0,Phil,1012,"But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel,"
6394,6229,0,Phil,1013,"so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ;"
6395,6230,0,Phil,1014,"and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
6396,6231,0,Phil,1015,"Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill:"
6397,6232,0,Phil,1016,"The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains;"
6398,6233,0,Phil,1017,"but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel."
6399,6234,0,Phil,1018,"What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice."
6400,6235,0,Phil,1019,"For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
6401,6236,0,Phil,1020,"according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death."
6402,6237,0,Phil,1021,"For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
6403,6238,0,Phil,1022,"But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell."
6404,6239,0,Phil,1023,"For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better."
6405,6240,0,Phil,1024,Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.
6406,6241,0,Phil,1025,"And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,"
6407,6242,0,Phil,1026,that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.
6408,6243,0,Phil,1027,"Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,"
6409,6244,0,Phil,1028,"and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God."
6410,6245,0,Phil,1029,"For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,"
6411,6246,0,Phil,1030,having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
6412,6247,0,Phil,2001,"Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,"
6413,6248,0,Phil,2002,"fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."
6414,6249,0,Phil,2003,"Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself."
6415,6250,0,Phil,2004,"Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others."
6416,6251,0,Phil,2005,"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,"
6417,6252,0,Phil,2006,"who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,"
6418,6253,0,Phil,2007,"but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men."
6419,6254,0,Phil,2008,"And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross."
6420,6255,0,Phil,2009,"Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name,"
6421,6256,0,Phil,2010,"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,"
6422,6257,0,Phil,2011,"and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
6423,6258,0,Phil,2012,"Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;"
6424,6259,0,Phil,2013,for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.
6425,6260,0,Phil,2014,"Do all things without complaining and disputing,"
6426,6261,0,Phil,2015,"that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,"
6427,6262,0,Phil,2016,"holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain."
6428,6263,0,Phil,2017,"Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all."
6429,6264,0,Phil,2018,For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.
6430,6265,0,Phil,2019,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state."
6431,6266,0,Phil,2020,"For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state."
6432,6267,0,Phil,2021,"For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus."
6433,6268,0,Phil,2022,"But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel."
6434,6269,0,Phil,2023,"Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me."
6435,6270,0,Phil,2024,But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.
6436,6271,0,Phil,2025,"Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and the one who ministered to my need;"
6437,6272,0,Phil,2026,"since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick."
6438,6273,0,Phil,2027,"For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
6439,6274,0,Phil,2028,"Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful."
6440,6275,0,Phil,2029,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem;"
6441,6276,0,Phil,2030,"because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me."
6442,6277,0,Phil,3001,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe."
6443,6278,0,Phil,3002,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilation!"
6444,6279,0,Phil,3003,"For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,"
6445,6280,0,Phil,3004,"though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:"
6446,6281,0,Phil,3005,"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;"
6447,6282,0,Phil,3006,"concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
6448,6283,0,Phil,3007,"But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ."
6449,6284,0,Phil,3008,"Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ."
6450,6285,0,Phil,3009,"and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;"
6451,6286,0,Phil,3010,"that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,"
6452,6287,0,Phil,3011,"if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
6453,6288,0,Phil,3012,"Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me."
6454,6289,0,Phil,3013,"Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,"
6455,6290,0,Phil,3014,I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
6456,6291,0,Phil,3015,"Therefore let us, as many as are mature, have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you."
6457,6292,0,Phil,3016,"Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind."
6458,6293,0,Phil,3017,"Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern."
6459,6294,0,Phil,3018,"For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:"
6460,6295,0,Phil,3019,"whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame &ndash; who set their mind on earthly things."
6461,6296,0,Phil,3020,"For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,"
6462,6297,0,Phil,3021,"who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself."
6463,6298,0,Phil,4001,"Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, beloved."
6464,6299,0,Phil,4002,I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
6465,6300,0,Phil,4003,"And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life."
6466,6301,0,Phil,4004,"Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!"
6467,6302,0,Phil,4005,Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
6468,6303,0,Phil,4006,"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;"
6469,6304,0,Phil,4007,"and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
6470,6305,0,Phil,4008,"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy &ndash; meditate on these things."
6471,6306,0,Phil,4009,"The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you."
6472,6307,0,Phil,4010,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again; though you surely did care, but you lacked opportunity."
6473,6308,0,Phil,4011,"Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content:"
6474,6309,0,Phil,4012,"I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
6475,6310,0,Phil,4013,I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
6476,6311,0,Phil,4014,Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my distress.
6477,6312,0,Phil,4015,"Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only."
6478,6313,0,Phil,4016,For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities.
6479,6314,0,Phil,4017,"Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account."
6480,6315,0,Phil,4018,"Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God."
6481,6316,0,Phil,4019,And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
6482,6317,0,Phil,4020,Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
6483,6318,0,Phil,4021,Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
6484,6319,0,Phil,4022,"All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar&rsquo;s household."
6485,6320,0,Phil,4023,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
6486,6321,0,Col,1001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
6487,6322,0,Col,1002,to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
6488,6323,0,Col,1003,"We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
6489,6324,0,Col,1004,"since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints;"
6490,6325,0,Col,1005,"because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,"
6491,6326,0,Col,1006,"which has come to you, as it has also in all the world, and is bringing forth fruit, as it is also among you since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;"
6492,6327,0,Col,1007,"as you also learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,"
6493,6328,0,Col,1008,who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
6494,6329,0,Col,1009,"For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
6495,6330,0,Col,1010,"that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
6496,6331,0,Col,1011,"strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy;"
6497,6332,0,Col,1012,giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.
6498,6333,0,Col,1013,"He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,"
6499,6334,0,Col,1014,"in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."
6500,6335,0,Col,1015,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
6501,6336,0,Col,1016,"For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him."
6502,6337,0,Col,1017,"And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist."
6503,6338,0,Col,1018,"And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence."
6504,6339,0,Col,1019,"For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell,"
6505,6340,0,Col,1020,"and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross."
6506,6341,0,Col,1021,"And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled"
6507,6342,0,Col,1022,"in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight &ndash; "
6508,6343,0,Col,1023,"if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister."
6509,6344,0,Col,1024,"I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church,"
6510,6345,0,Col,1025,"of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God,"
6511,6346,0,Col,1026,"the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints."
6512,6347,0,Col,1027,"To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
6513,6348,0,Col,1028,"Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."
6514,6349,0,Col,1029,"To this end I also labor, striving according to His working which works in me mightily."
6515,6350,0,Col,2001,"For I want you to know what a great conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,"
6516,6351,0,Col,2002,"that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,"
6517,6352,0,Col,2003,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
6518,6353,0,Col,2004,Now this I say lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words.
6519,6354,0,Col,2005,"For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
6520,6355,0,Col,2006,"As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,"
6521,6356,0,Col,2007,"rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving."
6522,6357,0,Col,2008,"Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ."
6523,6358,0,Col,2009,"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;"
6524,6359,0,Col,2010,"and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power."
6525,6360,0,Col,2011,"In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,"
6526,6361,0,Col,2012,"buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead."
6527,6362,0,Col,2013,"And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,"
6528,6363,0,Col,2014,"having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross."
6529,6364,0,Col,2015,"Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it."
6530,6365,0,Col,2016,"So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths,"
6531,6366,0,Col,2017,"which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ."
6532,6367,0,Col,2018,"Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
6533,6368,0,Col,2019,"and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God."
6534,6369,0,Col,2020,"Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations &ndash; "
6535,6370,0,Col,2021,"Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,"
6536,6371,0,Col,2022,"which all concern things which perish with the using &ndash; according to the commandments and doctrines of men?"
6537,6372,0,Col,2023,"These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh."
6538,6373,0,Col,3001,"If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God."
6539,6374,0,Col,3002,"Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth."
6540,6375,0,Col,3003,"For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
6541,6376,0,Col,3004,"When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory."
6542,6377,0,Col,3005,"Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry."
6543,6378,0,Col,3006,"Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,"
6544,6379,0,Col,3007,in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.
6545,6458,0,1Thess,3013,so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
6546,6459,0,1Thess,4001,"Finally then, brethren, we urge and exhort in the Lord Jesus that you should abound more and more, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God;"
6547,6460,0,1Thess,4002,for you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
6548,6461,0,1Thess,4003,"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality;"
6549,6462,0,1Thess,4004,"that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,"
6550,6463,0,1Thess,4005,"not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God;"
6551,6464,0,1Thess,4006,"that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified."
6552,6465,0,1Thess,4007,"For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness."
6553,6466,0,1Thess,4008,"Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit."
6554,6467,0,1Thess,4009,"But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;"
6555,6468,0,1Thess,4010,"and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you increase more and more;"
6556,6469,0,1Thess,4011,"that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,"
6557,6470,0,1Thess,4012,"that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may lack nothing."
6558,6471,0,1Thess,4013,"But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope."
6559,6472,0,1Thess,4014,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus."
6560,6473,0,1Thess,4015,"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep."
6561,6474,0,1Thess,4016,"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first."
6562,6475,0,1Thess,4017,Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.
6563,6476,0,1Thess,4018,Therefore comfort one another with these words.
6564,6477,0,1Thess,5001,"But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you."
6565,6478,0,1Thess,5002,For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.
6566,6479,0,1Thess,5003,"For when they say, &ldquo;Peace and safety!&rdquo; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape."
6567,6480,0,1Thess,5004,"But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief."
6568,6481,0,1Thess,5005,You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.
6569,6482,0,1Thess,5006,"Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober."
6570,6483,0,1Thess,5007,"For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night."
6571,6484,0,1Thess,5008,"But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation."
6572,6485,0,1Thess,5009,"For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
6573,6486,0,1Thess,5010,"who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him."
6574,6487,0,1Thess,5011,"Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing."
6575,6488,0,1Thess,5012,"And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,"
6576,6489,0,1Thess,5013,"and to esteem them very highly in love for their work&rsquo;s sake. Be at peace among yourselves."
6577,6490,0,1Thess,5014,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all."
6578,6491,0,1Thess,5015,"See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all."
6579,6492,0,1Thess,5016,"Rejoice always,"
6580,6493,0,1Thess,5017,"pray without ceasing,"
6581,6494,0,1Thess,5018,"in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."
6582,6495,0,1Thess,5019,Do not quench the Spirit.
6583,6496,0,1Thess,5020,Do not despise prophecies.
6584,6497,0,1Thess,5021,"Test all things; hold fast what is good."
6585,6498,0,1Thess,5022,Abstain from every form of evil.
6586,6499,0,1Thess,5023,"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
6587,6500,0,1Thess,5024,"He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it."
6588,6501,0,1Thess,5025,"Brethren, pray for us."
6589,6502,0,1Thess,5026,Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
6590,6503,0,1Thess,5027,I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
6591,6504,0,1Thess,5028,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
6592,6505,0,2Thess,1001,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
6593,6506,0,2Thess,1002,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
6594,6507,0,2Thess,1003,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other,"
6595,6508,0,2Thess,1004,"so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure,"
6596,6509,0,2Thess,1005,"which is manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer;"
6597,6510,0,2Thess,1006,"since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you,"
6598,6511,0,2Thess,1007,"and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels,"
6599,6512,0,2Thess,1008,"in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."
6600,6513,0,2Thess,1009,"These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"
6601,6514,0,2Thess,1010,"when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed."
6602,6515,0,2Thess,1011,"Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,"
6603,6516,0,2Thess,1012,"that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
6604,6517,0,2Thess,2001,"Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you,"
6605,6518,0,2Thess,2002,"not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come."
6606,6519,0,2Thess,2003,"Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition,"
6607,6520,0,2Thess,2004,"who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."
6608,6521,0,2Thess,2005,Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
6609,6522,0,2Thess,2006,"And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time."
6610,6523,0,2Thess,2007,"For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way."
6611,6524,0,2Thess,2008,"And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming."
6612,6525,0,2Thess,2009,"The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders,"
6613,6526,0,2Thess,2010,"and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
6614,6527,0,2Thess,2011,"And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie,"
6615,6528,0,2Thess,2012,that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
6616,6529,0,2Thess,2013,"But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth,"
6617,6530,0,2Thess,2014,"to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
6618,6531,0,2Thess,2015,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle."
6619,6532,0,2Thess,2016,"Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting consolation and good hope by grace,"
6620,6533,0,2Thess,2017,comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.
6621,6534,0,2Thess,3001,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it is with you,"
6622,6535,0,2Thess,3002,"and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith."
6623,6536,0,2Thess,3003,"But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one."
6624,6537,0,2Thess,3004,"And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you."
6625,6538,0,2Thess,3005,Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
6626,6539,0,2Thess,3006,"But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us."
6627,6540,0,2Thess,3007,"For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you;"
6628,6541,0,2Thess,3008,"nor did we eat anyone&rsquo;s bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,"
6629,6542,0,2Thess,3009,"not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us."
6630,6543,0,2Thess,3010,"For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat."
6631,6544,0,2Thess,3011,"For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies."
6632,6545,0,2Thess,3012,Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.
6633,6546,0,2Thess,3013,"But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good."
6634,6547,0,2Thess,3014,"And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed."
6635,6548,0,2Thess,3015,"Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
6636,6549,0,2Thess,3016,Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.
6637,6550,0,2Thess,3017,"The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write."
6638,6551,0,2Thess,3018,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
6639,6552,0,1Tim,1001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,"
6640,6553,0,1Tim,1002,"to Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
6641,6555,0,1Tim,1003,"As I urged you when I went into Macedonia &ndash; remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
6642,6556,0,1Tim,1004,"nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith."
6643,6557,0,1Tim,1005,"Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,"
6644,6558,0,1Tim,1006,"from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk,"
6645,6559,0,1Tim,1007,"desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm."
6646,6560,0,1Tim,1008,"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully,"
6647,6561,0,1Tim,1009,"knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
6648,6562,0,1Tim,1010,"for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,"
6649,6563,0,1Tim,1011,according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.
6650,6564,0,1Tim,1012,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,"
6651,6565,0,1Tim,1013,"although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
6652,6566,0,1Tim,1014,"And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
6653,6567,0,1Tim,1015,"This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief."
6654,6568,0,1Tim,1016,"However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life."
6655,6569,0,1Tim,1017,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
6656,6570,0,1Tim,1018,"This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,"
6657,6571,0,1Tim,1019,"having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck,"
6658,6572,0,1Tim,1020,"of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme."
6659,6573,0,1Tim,2001,"Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,"
6660,6574,0,1Tim,2002,"for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence."
6661,6575,0,1Tim,2003,"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,"
6662,6576,0,1Tim,2004,who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
6663,6577,0,1Tim,2005,"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,"
6664,6578,0,1Tim,2006,"who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,"
6665,6579,0,1Tim,2007,"for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle &ndash; I am speaking the truth in Christ and not lying &ndash; a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
6666,6580,0,1Tim,2008,"I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;"
6667,6581,0,1Tim,2009,"in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing,"
6668,6582,0,1Tim,2010,"but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works."
6669,6583,0,1Tim,2011,Let a woman learn in silence with all submission.
6670,6584,0,1Tim,2012,"And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence."
6671,6585,0,1Tim,2013,"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
6672,6586,0,1Tim,2014,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression."
6673,6587,0,1Tim,2015,"Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control."
6674,6588,0,1Tim,3001,"This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work."
6675,6589,0,1Tim,3002,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach;"
6676,6590,0,1Tim,3003,"not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;"
6677,6591,0,1Tim,3004,"one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all reverence"
6678,6592,0,1Tim,3005,"(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?);"
6679,6593,0,1Tim,3006,"not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil."
6680,6594,0,1Tim,3007,"Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
6681,6595,0,1Tim,3008,"Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money,"
6682,6596,0,1Tim,3009,holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
6683,6597,0,1Tim,3010,"But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless."
6684,6598,0,1Tim,3011,"Likewise, their wives must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things."
6685,6599,0,1Tim,3012,"Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
6686,6600,0,1Tim,3013,For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
6687,6601,0,1Tim,3014,"These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly;"
6688,6602,0,1Tim,3015,"but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
6689,6603,0,1Tim,3016,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory."
6690,6604,0,1Tim,4001,"Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,"
6691,6605,0,1Tim,4002,"speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron,"
6692,6606,0,1Tim,4003,"forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."
6693,6607,0,1Tim,4004,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving;"
6694,6608,0,1Tim,4005,for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
6695,6609,0,1Tim,4006,"If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed."
6696,6610,0,1Tim,4007,"But reject profane and old wives&rsquo; fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness."
6697,6611,0,1Tim,4008,"For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come."
6698,6612,0,1Tim,4009,This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.
6699,6613,0,1Tim,4010,"For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
6700,6614,0,1Tim,4011,These things command and teach.
6701,6615,0,1Tim,4012,"Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
6702,6616,0,1Tim,4013,"Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
6703,6617,0,1Tim,4014,"Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership."
6704,6618,0,1Tim,4015,"Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all."
6705,6619,0,1Tim,4016,"Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you."
6706,6620,0,1Tim,5001,"Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,"
6707,6621,0,1Tim,5002,"older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity."
6708,6622,0,1Tim,5003,Honor widows who are really widows.
6709,6623,0,1Tim,5004,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God."
6710,6624,0,1Tim,5005,"Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day."
6711,6625,0,1Tim,5006,But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
6712,6626,0,1Tim,5007,"And these things command, that they may be blameless."
6713,6627,0,1Tim,5008,"But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
6714,6628,0,1Tim,5009,"Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, and not unless she has been the wife of one man,"
6715,6629,0,1Tim,5010,"well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints&rsquo; feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work."
6716,6630,0,1Tim,5011,"But refuse the younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,"
6717,6631,0,1Tim,5012,having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith.
6718,6632,0,1Tim,5013,"And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not."
6719,6633,0,1Tim,5014,"Therefore I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
6720,6634,0,1Tim,5015,For some have already turned aside after Satan.
6721,6635,0,1Tim,5016,"If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows."
6722,6636,0,1Tim,5017,"Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine."
6723,6637,0,1Tim,5018,"For the Scripture says, &ldquo;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&rdquo;"
6724,6638,0,1Tim,5019,Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses.
6725,6639,0,1Tim,5020,"Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear."
6726,6640,0,1Tim,5021,"I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality."
6727,6641,0,1Tim,5022,"Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people&rsquo;s sins; keep yourself pure."
6728,6642,0,1Tim,5023,"No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach&rsquo;s sake and your frequent infirmities."
6729,6643,0,1Tim,5024,"Some men&rsquo;s sins are clearly evident, preceding them to judgment, but those of some men follow later."
6730,6644,0,1Tim,5025,"Likewise, the good works of some are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden."
6731,6645,0,1Tim,6001,"Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed."
6732,6646,0,1Tim,6002,"And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather serve them because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things."
6733,6647,0,1Tim,6003,"If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness,"
6734,6648,0,1Tim,6004,"he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,"
6735,6649,0,1Tim,6005,"useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself."
6736,6650,0,1Tim,6006,Now godliness with contentment is great gain.
6737,6651,0,1Tim,6007,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
6738,6652,0,1Tim,6008,"And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content."
6739,6653,0,1Tim,6009,"But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition."
6740,6654,0,1Tim,6010,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
6741,6655,0,1Tim,6011,"But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness."
6742,6656,0,1Tim,6012,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."
6743,6657,0,1Tim,6013,"I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,"
6744,6658,0,1Tim,6014,"that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ&rsquo;s appearing,"
6745,6659,0,1Tim,6015,"which He will manifest in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"
6746,6660,0,1Tim,6016,"who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen."
6747,6661,0,1Tim,6017,"Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy."
6748,6662,0,1Tim,6018,"Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share,"
6749,6663,0,1Tim,6019,"storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
6750,6664,0,1Tim,6020,"O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge &ndash; "
6751,6665,0,1Tim,6021,by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
6752,6666,0,2Tim,1001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
6753,6667,0,2Tim,1002,"to Timothy, a beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
6754,6668,0,2Tim,1003,"I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as my forefathers did, as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,"
6755,6669,0,2Tim,1004,"greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy,"
6756,6670,0,2Tim,1005,"when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also."
6757,6671,0,2Tim,1006,Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
6758,6672,0,2Tim,1007,"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."
6759,6673,0,2Tim,1008,"Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God,"
6760,6674,0,2Tim,1009,"who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began,"
6761,6675,0,2Tim,1010,"but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,"
6762,6676,0,2Tim,1011,"to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
6763,6677,0,2Tim,1012,"For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day."
6764,6678,0,2Tim,1013,"Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
6765,6679,0,2Tim,1014,"That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."
6766,6680,0,2Tim,1015,"This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
6767,6681,0,2Tim,1016,"The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;"
6768,6682,0,2Tim,1017,"but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found me."
6769,6683,0,2Tim,1018,"The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day &ndash; and you know very well how many ways he ministered to me at Ephesus."
6770,6684,0,2Tim,2001,"You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
6771,6685,0,2Tim,2002,"And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
6772,6686,0,2Tim,2003,You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
6773,6687,0,2Tim,2004,"No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier."
6774,6688,0,2Tim,2005,"And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules."
6775,6689,0,2Tim,2006,The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops.
6776,6690,0,2Tim,2007,"Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things."
6777,6691,0,2Tim,2008,"Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel,"
6778,6692,0,2Tim,2009,"for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even to the point of chains; but the word of God is not chained."
6779,6693,0,2Tim,2010,"Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
6780,6694,0,2Tim,2011,"This is a faithful saying: For if we died with Him, We shall also live with Him."
6781,6695,0,2Tim,2012,"If we endure, We shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us."
6782,6696,0,2Tim,2013,"If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself."
6783,6697,0,2Tim,2014,"Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers."
6784,6698,0,2Tim,2015,"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
6785,6699,0,2Tim,2016,"But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness."
6786,6700,0,2Tim,2017,"And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort,"
6787,6701,0,2Tim,2018,"who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some."
6788,6702,0,2Tim,2019,"Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.&rdquo;"
6789,6703,0,2Tim,2020,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor."
6790,6704,0,2Tim,2021,"Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work."
6791,6705,0,2Tim,2022,"Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
6792,6706,0,2Tim,2023,"But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife."
6793,6707,0,2Tim,2024,"And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,"
6794,6708,0,2Tim,2025,"in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth,"
6795,6709,0,2Tim,2026,"and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will."
6796,6710,0,2Tim,3001,"But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come:"
6797,6711,0,2Tim,3002,"For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
6798,6712,0,2Tim,3003,"unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good,"
6799,6713,0,2Tim,3004,"traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,"
6800,6714,0,2Tim,3005,having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!
6801,6715,0,2Tim,3006,"For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,"
6802,6716,0,2Tim,3007,always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
6803,6717,0,2Tim,3008,"Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith;"
6804,6718,0,2Tim,3009,"but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was."
6805,6719,0,2Tim,3010,"But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,"
6806,6720,0,2Tim,3011,"persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra &ndash; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me."
6807,6721,0,2Tim,3012,"Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution."
6808,6722,0,2Tim,3013,"But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived."
6809,6723,0,2Tim,3014,"But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,"
6810,6724,0,2Tim,3015,"and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
6811,6725,0,2Tim,3016,"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,"
6812,6726,0,2Tim,3017,"that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
6813,6727,0,2Tim,4001,"I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:"
6814,6728,0,2Tim,4002,"Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching."
6815,6729,0,2Tim,4003,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;"
6816,6730,0,2Tim,4004,"and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables."
6817,6731,0,2Tim,4005,"But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry."
6818,6732,0,2Tim,4006,"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand."
6819,6733,0,2Tim,4007,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."
6820,6734,0,2Tim,4008,"Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing."
6821,6735,0,2Tim,4009,"Be diligent to come to me quickly;"

6829,6743,0,2Tim,4017,"But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the message might be preached fully through me, and that all the Gentiles might hear. Also I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."

6840,6754,0,Titus,1006,"if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or insubordination."
6841,6755,0,Titus,1007,"For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money,"
6842,6756,0,Titus,1008,"but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled,"
6843,6757,0,Titus,1009,"holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict."
6844,6758,0,Titus,1010,"For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,"
6845,6759,0,Titus,1011,"whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain."
6846,6760,0,Titus,1012,"One of them, a prophet of their own, said, &ldquo;Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.&rdquo;"
6847,6761,0,Titus,1013,"This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
6848,6762,0,Titus,1014,not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth.
6849,6763,0,Titus,1015,"To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled."
6850,6764,0,Titus,1016,"They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work."
6851,6765,0,Titus,2001,"But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine:"
6852,6766,0,Titus,2002,"that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience;"
6853,6767,0,Titus,2003,"the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things &ndash; "
6854,6768,0,Titus,2004,"that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,"
6855,6769,0,Titus,2005,"to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed."
6856,6770,0,Titus,2006,"Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded,"
6857,6771,0,Titus,2007,"in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, "
6858,6772,0,Titus,2008,"sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you. "
6859,6773,0,Titus,2009,"Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back,"
6860,6774,0,Titus,2010,"not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things."
6861,6775,0,Titus,2011,"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"
6862,6776,0,Titus,2012,"teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age,"
6863,6777,0,Titus,2013,"looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,"
6864,6778,0,Titus,2014,"who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works."
6865,6779,0,Titus,2015,"Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you."
6866,6780,0,Titus,3001,"Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,"
6867,6781,0,Titus,3002,"to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men."
6868,6782,0,Titus,3003,"For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another."
6869,6783,0,Titus,3004,"But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,"
6870,6784,0,Titus,3005,"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,"
6871,6785,0,Titus,3006,"whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
6872,6786,0,Titus,3007,that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
6873,6787,0,Titus,3008,"This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men."
6874,6788,0,Titus,3009,"But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless."
6875,6789,0,Titus,3010,"Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition,"
6876,6790,0,Titus,3011,"knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned."

6892,6806,0,Philemon,1012,"I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,"
6893,6807,0,Philemon,1013,"whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel."
6894,6808,0,Philemon,1014,"But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary."
6895,6809,0,Philemon,1015,"For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever,"
6896,6810,0,Philemon,1016,"no longer as a slave but more than a slave &ndash; a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
6897,6811,0,Philemon,1017,"If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me."
6898,6812,0,Philemon,1018,"But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account."
6899,6813,0,Philemon,1019,"I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay &ndash; not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides."

6906,6820,0,Heb,1001,"God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,"
6907,6821,0,Heb,1002,"has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds;"
6908,6822,0,Heb,1003,"who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
6909,6823,0,Heb,1004,"having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
6910,6824,0,Heb,1005,"For to which of the angels did He ever say: &ldquo;You are My Son, today I have begotten You&rdquo;? And again: &ldquo;I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son&rdquo;?"
6911,6825,0,Heb,1006,"But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: &ldquo;Let all the angels of God worship Him.&rdquo;"
6912,6826,0,Heb,1007,"And of the angels He says: &ldquo;Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire.&rdquo;"
6913,6827,0,Heb,1008,"But to the Son He says: &ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom."
6914,6828,0,Heb,1009,"You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.&rdquo;"
6915,6829,0,Heb,1010,"And: &ldquo;You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands."
6916,6830,0,Heb,1011,"They will perish, but You remain; and they will all grow old like a garment;"
6917,6831,0,Heb,1012,"like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo;"
6918,6832,0,Heb,1013,"But to which of the angels has He ever said: &ldquo;Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool&rdquo;?"
6919,6833,0,Heb,1014,Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?
6920,6834,0,Heb,2001,"Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away."
6921,6835,0,Heb,2002,"For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward,"
6922,6836,0,Heb,2003,"how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,"
6923,6837,0,Heb,2004,"God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?"
6924,6838,0,Heb,2005,"For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels."
6925,6839,0,Heb,2006,"But one testified in a certain place, saying: &ldquo;What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You take care of him?"
6926,6840,0,Heb,2007,"You have made him a little lower than the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of Your hands."
6927,6841,0,Heb,2008,"You have put all things in subjection under his feet.&rdquo; For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him."
6928,6842,0,Heb,2009,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone."
6929,6843,0,Heb,2010,"For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
6930,6844,0,Heb,2011,"For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
6931,6845,0,Heb,2012,"saying: &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brethren; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.&rdquo;"
6932,6846,0,Heb,2013,"And again: &ldquo;I will put My trust in Him.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.&rdquo;"
6933,6847,0,Heb,2014,"Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,"
6934,6848,0,Heb,2015,and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
6935,6849,0,Heb,2016,"For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham."
6936,6850,0,Heb,2017,"Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
6937,6851,0,Heb,2018,"For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted."
6938,6852,0,Heb,3001,"Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,"
6939,6853,0,Heb,3002,"who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house."
6940,6854,0,Heb,3003,"For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house."
6941,6855,0,Heb,3004,"For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God."
6942,6856,0,Heb,3005,"And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken afterward,"
6943,6857,0,Heb,3006,"but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end."
6944,6858,0,Heb,3007,"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: &ldquo;Today, if you will hear His voice,"
6945,6859,0,Heb,3008,"do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness,"
6946,6860,0,Heb,3009,"where your fathers tested Me, tried Me, and saw My works forty years."
6947,6861,0,Heb,3010,"Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, &lsquo;They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways.&rsquo;"
6948,6862,0,Heb,3011,"So I swore in My wrath, &lsquo;They shall not enter My rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
6949,6863,0,Heb,3012,"Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;"
6950,6864,0,Heb,3013,"but exhort one another daily, while it is called &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
6951,6865,0,Heb,3014,"For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end,"
6952,6866,0,Heb,3015,"while it is said: &ldquo;Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.&rdquo;"
6953,6867,0,Heb,3016,"For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt, led by Moses?"
6954,6868,0,Heb,3017,"Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?"
6955,6869,0,Heb,3018,"And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?"
6956,6870,0,Heb,3019,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
6957,6959,0,Heb,8011,"None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, &lsquo;Know the LORD,&rsquo; for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them."
6958,6960,0,Heb,8012,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;"
6959,6961,0,Heb,8013,"In that He says, &ldquo;A new covenant,&rdquo; He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."
6960,6962,0,Heb,9001,"Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary."
6961,6963,0,Heb,9002,"For a tabernacle was prepared: the first part, in which was the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary;"
6962,6964,0,Heb,9003,"and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All,"
6963,6965,0,Heb,9004,"which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron&rsquo;s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;"
6964,6966,0,Heb,9005,and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
6965,6967,0,Heb,9006,"Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services."
6966,6968,0,Heb,9007,"But into the second part the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the people&rsquo;s sins committed in ignorance;"
6967,6969,0,Heb,9008,"the Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing."
6968,6970,0,Heb,9009,"It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience &ndash; "
6969,6971,0,Heb,9010,"concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation."
6970,6972,0,Heb,9011,"But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation."
6971,6973,0,Heb,9012,"Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption."
6972,6974,0,Heb,9013,"For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,"
6973,6975,0,Heb,9014,"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
6974,6976,0,Heb,9015,"And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance."
6975,6977,0,Heb,9016,"For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
6976,6978,0,Heb,9017,"For a testament is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives."
6977,6979,0,Heb,9018,Therefore not even the first covenant was dedicated without blood.
6978,6980,0,Heb,9019,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,"
6979,6981,0,Heb,9020,"saying, &ldquo;This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.&rdquo;"
6980,6982,0,Heb,9021,Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.
6981,6983,0,Heb,9022,"And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission."
6982,6984,0,Heb,9023,"Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
6983,6985,0,Heb,9024,"For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;"
6984,6986,0,Heb,9025,"not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another &ndash; "
6985,6987,0,Heb,9026,"He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."
6986,6988,0,Heb,9027,"And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment,"
6987,6989,0,Heb,9028,"so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation."
6988,6990,0,Heb,10001,"For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect."
6989,6991,0,Heb,10002,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins."
6990,6992,0,Heb,10003,But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
6991,6993,0,Heb,10004,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.
6992,6994,0,Heb,10005,"Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me."
6993,6995,0,Heb,10006,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure.
6994,6996,0,Heb,10007,"Then I said, &lsquo;Behold, I have come &ndash; in the volume of the book it is written of Me &ndash; to do Your will, O God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
6995,6997,0,Heb,10008,"Previously saying, &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure in them&rdquo; (which are offered according to the law),"
6996,6998,0,Heb,10009,"then He said, &ldquo;Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.&rdquo; He takes away the first that He may establish the second."
6997,6999,0,Heb,10010,By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
6998,7000,0,Heb,10011,"And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins."
6999,7001,0,Heb,10012,"But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,"
7000,7002,0,Heb,10013,from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.
7001,7003,0,Heb,10014,For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
7002,7004,0,Heb,10015,"But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,"
7003,7005,0,Heb,10016,"&ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,&rdquo; says the LORD: &ldquo;I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,&rdquo;"
7004,7006,0,Heb,10017,"then He adds, &ldquo;Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;"
7005,7007,0,Heb,10018,"Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin."
7006,7008,0,Heb,10019,"Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
7007,7009,0,Heb,10020,"by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,"
7008,7010,0,Heb,10021,"and having a High Priest over the house of God,"
7009,7011,0,Heb,10022,"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
7010,7012,0,Heb,10023,"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful."
7011,7013,0,Heb,10024,"And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,"
7012,7014,0,Heb,10025,"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching."
7013,7015,0,Heb,10026,"For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,"
7014,7016,0,Heb,10027,"but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries."
7015,7017,0,Heb,10028,"Anyone who has rejected Moses&rsquo; law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
7016,7018,0,Heb,10029,"Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?"
7017,7019,0,Heb,10030,"For we know Him who said, &ldquo;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,&rdquo; says the Lord. And again, &ldquo;The LORD will judge His people.&rdquo;"
7018,7020,0,Heb,10031,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
7019,7021,0,Heb,10032,"But recall the former days in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great struggle with sufferings:"
7020,7022,0,Heb,10033,"partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and partly while you became companions of those who were so treated;"
7021,7023,0,Heb,10034,"for you had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves in heaven."
7022,7024,0,Heb,10035,"Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward."
7023,7025,0,Heb,10036,"For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:"
7024,7026,0,Heb,10037,"&ldquo;For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not tarry."
7025,7027,0,Heb,10038,"Now the just shall live by faith; but if anyone draws back, my soul has no pleasure in him.&rdquo;"
7026,7028,0,Heb,10039,"But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul."
7027,7029,0,Heb,11001,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
7028,7030,0,Heb,11002,For by it the elders obtained a good testimony.
7029,7031,0,Heb,11003,"By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible."
7030,7032,0,Heb,11004," By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks."
7031,7033,0,Heb,11005,"By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, &ldquo;and was not found, because God had taken him&rdquo;; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
7032,7034,0,Heb,11006,"But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him."
7033,7035,0,Heb,11007,"By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
7034,7036,0,Heb,11008," By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going."
7035,7037,0,Heb,11009,"By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;"
7036,7038,0,Heb,11010,"for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
7037,7039,0,Heb,11011,"By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised."
7038,7040,0,Heb,11012,"Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude &ndash; innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore."
7039,7041,0,Heb,11013,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
7040,7042,0,Heb,11014,For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland.
7041,7043,0,Heb,11015,"And truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return."
7042,7044,0,Heb,11016,"But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them."
7043,7045,0,Heb,11017,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"
7044,7046,0,Heb,11018,"of whom it was said, &ldquo;In Isaac your seed shall be called,&rdquo;"
7045,7047,0,Heb,11019,"concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense."
7046,7048,0,Heb,11020,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
7047,7049,0,Heb,11021,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff."
7048,7050,0,Heb,11022,"By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones."
7049,7051,0,Heb,11023,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king&rsquo;s command."
7050,7052,0,Heb,11024,"By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter,"
7051,7053,0,Heb,11025,"choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,"
7052,7054,0,Heb,11026,"esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward."
7053,7055,0,Heb,11027,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible."
7054,7056,0,Heb,11028,"By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
7055,7057,0,Heb,11029,"By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, whereas the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned."
7056,7058,0,Heb,11030,By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days.
7057,7059,0,Heb,11031,"By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace."
7058,7060,0,Heb,11032,"And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets:"
7059,7061,0,Heb,11033,"who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
7060,7062,0,Heb,11034,"quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
7061,7063,0,Heb,11035,"Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection."
7062,7064,0,Heb,11036,"Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment."
7063,7065,0,Heb,11037,"They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented &ndash; "
7064,7066,0,Heb,11038,"of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth."
7065,7067,0,Heb,11039,"And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise,"
7066,7068,0,Heb,11040,"God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us."
7067,7069,0,Heb,12001,"Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,"
7068,7070,0,Heb,12002,"looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
7069,7071,0,Heb,12003,"For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls."
7070,7072,0,Heb,12004,"You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin."
7071,7073,0,Heb,12005,"And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: &ldquo;My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;"
7072,7074,0,Heb,12006,"for whom the LORD loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.&rdquo;"
7073,7075,0,Heb,12007,"If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten?"
7074,7076,0,Heb,12008,"But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons."
7075,7077,0,Heb,12009,"Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?"
7076,7078,0,Heb,12010,"For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness."
7077,7079,0,Heb,12011,"Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
7078,7080,0,Heb,12012,"Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,"
7079,7081,0,Heb,12013,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed."
7080,7082,0,Heb,12014,"Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord:"
7081,7083,0,Heb,12015,"looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled;"
7082,7084,0,Heb,12016,"lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright."
7083,7085,0,Heb,12017,"For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears."
7084,7086,0,Heb,12018,"For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,"
7085,7087,0,Heb,12019,"and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore."
7086,7088,0,Heb,12020,"(For they could not endure what was commanded: &ldquo;And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.&rdquo;"
7087,7089,0,Heb,12021,"And so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, &ldquo;I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.&rdquo;)"
7088,7090,0,Heb,12022,"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels,"
7089,7091,0,Heb,12023,"to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
7090,7092,0,Heb,12024,"to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel."
7091,7093,0,Heb,12025,"See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven,"
7092,7094,0,Heb,12026,"whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, &ldquo;Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also heaven.&rdquo;"
7093,7095,0,Heb,12027,"Now this, &ldquo;Yet once more,&rdquo; indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain."
7094,7096,0,Heb,12028,"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear."
7095,7097,0,Heb,12029,For our God is a consuming fire.
7096,7098,0,Heb,13001,Let brotherly love continue.
7097,7099,0,Heb,13002,"Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels."
7098,7100,0,Heb,13003,"Remember the prisoners as if chained with them &ndash; those who are mistreated &ndash; since you yourselves are in the body also."
7099,7101,0,Heb,13004,"Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge."
7100,7102,0,Heb,13005,"Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, &ldquo;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&rdquo;"
7101,7103,0,Heb,13006,"So we may boldly say: &ldquo;The LORD is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?&rdquo;"
7102,7104,0,Heb,13007," Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of their conduct."
7103,7105,0,Heb,13008,"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
7104,7106,0,Heb,13009,"Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them."
7105,7107,0,Heb,13010,We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
7106,7108,0,Heb,13011,"For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp."
7107,7109,0,Heb,13012,"Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate."
7108,7110,0,Heb,13013,"Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach."
7109,7111,0,Heb,13014,"For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come."
7110,7112,0,Heb,13015,"Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name."
7111,7113,0,Heb,13016,"But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
7112,7114,0,Heb,13017,"Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you."
7113,7115,0,Heb,13018,"Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably."
7114,7116,0,Heb,13019,"But I especially urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
7115,7117,0,Heb,13020,"Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
7116,7118,0,Heb,13021,"make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
7117,7119,0,Heb,13022,"And I appeal to you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words."
7118,7120,0,Heb,13023,"Know that our brother Timothy has been set free, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly."
7119,7121,0,Heb,13024,"Greet all those who rule over you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you."
7120,7122,0,Heb,13025,Grace be with you all. Amen.
7121,7123,0,James,1001,"James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings."
7122,7124,0,James,1002,"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,"
7123,7125,0,James,1003,knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
7124,7126,0,James,1004,"But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing."
7125,7127,0,James,1005,"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
7126,7128,0,James,1006,"But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind."
7127,7129,0,James,1007,"For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;"
7128,7130,0,James,1008,"he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
7129,7131,0,James,1009,"Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation,"
7130,7132,0,James,1010,"but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away."
7131,7133,0,James,1011,"For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits."
7132,7134,0,James,1012,"Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him."
7133,7135,0,James,1013,"Let no one say when he is tempted, &ldquo;I am tempted by God&rdquo;; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone."
7134,7136,0,James,1014,But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.
7135,7137,0,James,1015,"Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death."
7136,7138,0,James,1016,"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren."
7137,7139,0,James,1017,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning."
7138,7140,0,James,1018,"Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures."
7139,7141,0,James,1019,"So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;"
7140,7142,0,James,1020,for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
7141,7143,0,James,1021,"Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."
7142,7144,0,James,1022,"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."
7143,7145,0,James,1023,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;"
7144,7146,0,James,1024,"for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was."
7145,7147,0,James,1025,"But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does."
7146,7148,0,James,1026,"If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one&rsquo;s religion is useless."
7147,7149,0,James,1027,"Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world."
7148,7150,0,James,2001,"My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality."
7149,7151,0,James,2002,"For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes,"
7150,7152,0,James,2003,"and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, &ldquo;You sit here in a good place,&rdquo; and say to the poor man, &ldquo;You stand there,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Sit here at my footstool,&rdquo;"
7151,7153,0,James,2004,"have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?"
7152,7154,0,James,2005,"Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?"
7153,7155,0,James,2006,But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?
7154,7156,0,James,2007,Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?
7155,7157,0,James,2008,"If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; you do well;"
7156,7158,0,James,2009,"but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
7157,7159,0,James,2010,"For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all."
7158,7160,0,James,2011,"For He who said, &ldquo;Do not commit adultery,&rdquo; also said, &ldquo;Do not murder.&rdquo; Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
7159,7161,0,James,2012,So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.
7160,7162,0,James,2013,For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
7161,7163,0,James,2014,"What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?"
7162,7164,0,James,2015,"If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,"
7163,7165,0,James,2016,"and one of you says to them, &ldquo;Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,&rdquo; but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?"
7164,7166,0,James,2017,"Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."
7165,7167,0,James,2018,"But someone will say, &ldquo;You have faith, and I have works.&rdquo; Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
7166,7168,0,James,2019,"You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe &ndash; and tremble!"
7167,7169,0,James,2020,"But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?"
7168,7170,0,James,2021,Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
7169,7171,0,James,2022,"Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?"
7170,7172,0,James,2023,"And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo; And he was called the friend of God."
7171,7173,0,James,2024,"You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only."
7172,7174,0,James,2025,"Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?"
7173,7175,0,James,2026,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
7174,7176,0,James,3001,"My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment."
7175,7177,0,James,3002,"For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body."
7176,7178,0,James,3003,"Indeed, we put bits in horses&rsquo; mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body."
7177,7179,0,James,3004,"Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires."
7178,7180,0,James,3005,Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles!
7179,7181,0,James,3006,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell."
7180,7182,0,James,3007,"For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind."
7181,7183,0,James,3008,"But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
7182,7184,0,James,3009,"With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God."
7183,7185,0,James,3010,"Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so."
7184,7186,0,James,3011,Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?
7185,7187,0,James,3012,"Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh."
7186,7188,0,James,3013,Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.
7187,7189,0,James,3014,"But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth."
7188,7190,0,James,3015,"This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic."
7189,7191,0,James,3016,"For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there."
7190,7192,0,James,3017,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy."
7191,7193,0,James,3018,Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
7192,7194,0,James,4001,Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?
7193,7195,0,James,4002,You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask.
7194,7196,0,James,4003,"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures."
7195,7197,0,James,4004,Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
7196,7198,0,James,4005,"Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, &ldquo;The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously&rdquo;?"
7197,7199,0,James,4006,"But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: &ldquo;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo;"
7198,7200,0,James,4007,Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
7199,7201,0,James,4008,"Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
7200,7202,0,James,4009,Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
7201,7203,0,James,4010,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up."
7202,7204,0,James,4011,"Do not speak evil of one another, brethren. He who speaks evil of a brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge."
7203,7205,0,James,4012,"There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?"
7204,7206,0,James,4013,"Come now, you who say, &ldquo;Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit&rdquo;;"
7205,7207,0,James,4014,whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.
7206,7208,0,James,4015,"Instead you ought to say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.&rdquo;"
7207,7209,0,James,4016,But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
7208,7210,0,James,4017,"Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin."
7209,7211,0,James,5001,"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you!"
7210,7212,0,James,5002,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten."
7211,7213,0,James,5003,"Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days."
7212,7214,0,James,5004,"Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth."
7213,7215,0,James,5005,"You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter."
7214,7216,0,James,5006,"You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you."
7215,7217,0,James,5007,"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain."
7216,7218,0,James,5008,"You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand."
7217,7219,0,James,5009,"Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door!"
7218,7220,0,James,5010,"My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and patience."
7219,7221,0,James,5011,"Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end intended by the Lord &ndash; that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful."
7220,7222,0,James,5012,"But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; be &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and your &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; lest you fall into judgment."
7221,7223,0,James,5013,Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.
7222,7224,0,James,5014,"Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."
7223,7225,0,James,5015,"And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven."
7224,7226,0,James,5016,"Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."
7225,7227,0,James,5017,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months."
7226,7228,0,James,5018,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit."
7227,7229,0,James,5019,"Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,"
7228,7230,0,James,5020,let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.
7229,7231,0,1Peter,1001,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
7230,7232,0,1Peter,1002,"elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied."
7231,7233,0,1Peter,1003,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
7232,7234,0,1Peter,1004,"to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,"
7233,7235,0,1Peter,1005,who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
7234,7236,0,1Peter,1006,"In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,"
7235,7237,0,1Peter,1007,"that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
7236,7238,0,1Peter,1008,"whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,"
7237,7239,0,1Peter,1009,"receiving the end of your faith &ndash; the salvation of your souls."
7238,7240,0,1Peter,1010,"Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,"
7239,7241,0,1Peter,1011,"searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow."
7240,7242,0,1Peter,1012,"To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven &ndash; things which angels desire to look into."
7241,7243,0,1Peter,1013,"Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
7242,7244,0,1Peter,1014,"as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance;"
7243,7245,0,1Peter,1015,"but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,"
7244,7246,0,1Peter,1016,"because it is written, &ldquo;Be holy, for I am holy.&rdquo;"
7245,7247,0,1Peter,1017,"And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one&rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear;"
7246,7248,0,1Peter,1018,"knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers,"
7247,7249,0,1Peter,1019,"but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
7248,7250,0,1Peter,1020,"He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you"
7249,7251,0,1Peter,1021,"who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
7250,7252,0,1Peter,1022,"Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart,"
7251,7253,0,1Peter,1023,"having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever,"
7252,7254,0,1Peter,1024,"because &ldquo;All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,"
7253,7255,0,1Peter,1025,"but the word of the LORD endures forever.&rdquo; Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you."
7254,7256,0,1Peter,2001,"Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking,"
7255,7257,0,1Peter,2002,"as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby,"
7256,7258,0,1Peter,2003,if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
7257,7259,0,1Peter,2004,"Coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,"
7258,7260,0,1Peter,2005,"you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
7259,7261,0,1Peter,2006,"Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.&rdquo;"
7260,7262,0,1Peter,2007,"Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, &ldquo;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,&rdquo;"
7261,7263,0,1Peter,2008,"and &ldquo;A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.&rdquo; They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed."
7262,7264,0,1Peter,2009,"But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;"
7263,7265,0,1Peter,2010,"who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy."
7264,7266,0,1Peter,2011,"Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,"
7265,7267,0,1Peter,2012,"having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation."
7266,7268,0,1Peter,2013,"Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, whether to the king as supreme,"
7267,7269,0,1Peter,2014,"or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good."
7268,7270,0,1Peter,2015,"For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men &ndash; "
7269,7271,0,1Peter,2016,"as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God."
7270,7272,0,1Peter,2017,Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
7271,7273,0,1Peter,2018,"Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh."
7272,7274,0,1Peter,2019,"For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully."
7273,7275,0,1Peter,2020,"For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God."
7274,7276,0,1Peter,2021,"For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:"
7275,7277,0,1Peter,2022,"&ldquo;Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth&rdquo;;"
7276,7278,0,1Peter,2023,"who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously;"
7277,7279,0,1Peter,2024,"who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness &ndash; by whose stripes you were healed."
7278,7280,0,1Peter,2025,"For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."
7279,7281,0,1Peter,3001,"Wives, likewise, be submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives,"
7280,7282,0,1Peter,3002,when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear.
7281,7283,0,1Peter,3003,"Do not let your adornment be merely outward &ndash; arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel &ndash; "
7282,7284,0,1Peter,3004,"rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God."
7283,7285,0,1Peter,3005,"For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands,"
7284,7286,0,1Peter,3006,"as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror."
7285,7287,0,1Peter,3007,"Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered."
7286,7288,0,1Peter,3008,"Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be courteous;"
7287,7289,0,1Peter,3009,"not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing."
7288,7290,0,1Peter,3010,"For &ldquo;He who would love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit."
7289,7291,0,1Peter,3011,"Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it."
7290,7292,0,1Peter,3012,"For the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the LORD is against those who do evil.&rdquo;"
7291,7293,0,1Peter,3013,And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good?
7292,7294,0,1Peter,3014,"But even if you should suffer for righteousness&rsquo; sake, you are blessed. &ldquo;And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.&rdquo;"
7293,7295,0,1Peter,3015,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;"
7294,7296,0,1Peter,3016,"having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed."
7295,7297,0,1Peter,3017,"For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil."
7296,7298,0,1Peter,3018,"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,"
7297,7299,0,1Peter,3019,"by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,"
7298,7300,0,1Peter,3020,"who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water."
7299,7301,0,1Peter,3021,"There is also an antitype which now saves us &ndash; baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
7300,7302,0,1Peter,3022,"who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him."
7301,7303,0,1Peter,4001,"Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,"
7302,7304,0,1Peter,4002,"that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God."
7303,7305,0,1Peter,4003,"For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles &ndash; when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries."
7304,7306,0,1Peter,4004,"In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with them in the same flood of dissipation, speaking evil of you."
7305,7307,0,1Peter,4005,They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
7306,7308,0,1Peter,4006,"For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
7307,7309,0,1Peter,4007,"But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers."
7308,7310,0,1Peter,4008,"And above all things have fervent love for one another, for &ldquo;love will cover a multitude of sins.&rdquo;"
7309,7311,0,1Peter,4009,Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
7310,7312,0,1Peter,4010,"As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
7311,7313,0,1Peter,4011,"If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
7312,7314,0,1Peter,4012,"Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you;"
7313,7315,0,1Peter,4013,"but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy."
7314,7316,0,1Peter,4014,"If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified."
7315,7317,0,1Peter,4015,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people&rsquo;s matters."
7316,7318,0,1Peter,4016,"Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter."
7317,7319,0,1Peter,4017,"For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
7318,7320,0,1Peter,4018,"Now &ldquo;If the righteous one is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?&rdquo;"
7319,7321,0,1Peter,4019,"Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator."
7320,7322,0,1Peter,5001,"The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:"
7321,7323,0,1Peter,5002,"Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly;"
7322,7324,0,1Peter,5003,"nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;"
7323,7325,0,1Peter,5004,"and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away."
7324,7326,0,1Peter,5005,"Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for &ldquo;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo;"
7325,7327,0,1Peter,5006,"Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,"
7326,7328,0,1Peter,5007,"casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you."
7327,7329,0,1Peter,5008,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour."
7328,7330,0,1Peter,5009,"Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world."
7329,7331,0,1Peter,5010,"But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you."
7330,7332,0,1Peter,5011,To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
7331,7333,0,1Peter,5012,"By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand."
7332,7334,0,1Peter,5013,"She who is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son."
7333,7335,0,1Peter,5014,Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
7334,7336,0,2Peter,1001,"Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:"
7335,7337,0,2Peter,1002,"Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,"
7336,7338,0,2Peter,1003,"as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,"
7337,7339,0,2Peter,1004,"by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
7338,7340,0,2Peter,1005,"But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge,"
7339,7341,0,2Peter,1006,"to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness,"
7340,7342,0,2Peter,1007,"to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love."
7341,7343,0,2Peter,1008,"For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
7342,7344,0,2Peter,1009,"For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins."
7343,7345,0,2Peter,1010,"Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble;"
7344,7346,0,2Peter,1011,for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
7345,7347,0,2Peter,1012,"For this reason I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things, though you know and are established in the present truth."
7346,7348,0,2Peter,1013,"Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you,"
7347,7349,0,2Peter,1014,"knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me."
7348,7350,0,2Peter,1015,Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my decease.
7349,7351,0,2Peter,1016,"For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty."
7350,7352,0,2Peter,1017,"For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo;"
7351,7353,0,2Peter,1018,And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
7352,7354,0,2Peter,1019,"And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;"
7353,7355,0,2Peter,1020,"knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation,"
7354,7356,0,2Peter,1021,"for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."
7355,7357,0,2Peter,2001,"But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction."
7356,7358,0,2Peter,2002,"And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed."
7357,7359,0,2Peter,2003,"By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber."
7358,7360,0,2Peter,2004,"For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;"
7359,7361,0,2Peter,2005,"and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;"
7360,7362,0,2Peter,2006,"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly;"
7361,7363,0,2Peter,2007,"and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked"
7362,7364,0,2Peter,2008,"(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds) &ndash; "
7363,7365,0,2Peter,2009,"then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment,"
7364,7366,0,2Peter,2010,"and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries,"
7365,7367,0,2Peter,2011,"whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord."
7366,7368,0,2Peter,2012,"But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption,"
7367,7369,0,2Peter,2013,"and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you,"
7368,7370,0,2Peter,2014,"having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, and are accursed children."
7369,7371,0,2Peter,2015,"They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
7370,7372,0,2Peter,2016,"but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man&rsquo;s voice restrained the madness of the prophet."
7371,7373,0,2Peter,2017,"These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
7372,7374,0,2Peter,2018,"For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error."
7373,7375,0,2Peter,2019,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage."
7374,7376,0,2Peter,2020,"For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning."
7375,7377,0,2Peter,2021,"For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them."
7376,7378,0,2Peter,2022,"But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: &ldquo;A dog returns to his own vomit,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.&rdquo;"
7377,7379,0,2Peter,3001,"Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder),"
7378,7380,0,2Peter,3002,"that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior,"
7379,7381,0,2Peter,3003,"knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts,"
7380,7382,0,2Peter,3004,"and saying, &ldquo;Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.&rdquo;"
7381,7383,0,2Peter,3005,"For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water,"
7382,7384,0,2Peter,3006,"by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water."
7383,7385,0,2Peter,3007,"But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
7384,7386,0,2Peter,3008,"But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
7385,7387,0,2Peter,3009,"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance."
7386,7388,0,2Peter,3010,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up."
7387,7389,0,2Peter,3011,"Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,"
7388,7390,0,2Peter,3012,"looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?"
7389,7391,0,2Peter,3013,"Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."
7390,7392,0,2Peter,3014,"Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless;"
7391,7393,0,2Peter,3015,"and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation &ndash; as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you,"
7392,7394,0,2Peter,3016,"as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures."
7393,7395,0,2Peter,3017,"You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked;"
7394,7396,0,2Peter,3018,but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.
7395,7397,0,1John,1001,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life &ndash; "
7396,7398,0,1John,1002,"the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us &ndash; "
7397,7399,0,1John,1003,"that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ."
7398,7400,0,1John,1004,And these things we write to you that your joy may be full.
7399,7401,0,1John,1005,"This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all."
7400,7402,0,1John,1006,"If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth."
7401,7403,0,1John,1007,"But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin."
7402,7404,0,1John,1008,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
7403,7405,0,1John,1009,"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
7404,7406,0,1John,1010,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us."
7405,7407,0,1John,2001,"My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."
7406,7408,0,1John,2002,"And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world."
7407,7409,0,1John,2003,"Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments."
7408,7410,0,1John,2004,"He who says, &ldquo;I know Him,&rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
7409,7411,0,1John,2005,"But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him."
7410,7412,0,1John,2006,He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
7411,7413,0,1John,2007,"Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning."
7412,7414,0,1John,2008,"Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining."
7413,7415,0,1John,2009,"He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now."
7414,7416,0,1John,2010,"He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him."
7415,7417,0,1John,2011,"But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
7416,7418,0,1John,2012,"I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for His name&rsquo;s sake."
7417,7419,0,1John,2013,"I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father."
7418,7420,0,1John,2014,"I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one."
7419,7421,0,1John,2015,"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
7420,7422,0,1John,2016,"For all that is in the world &ndash; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life &ndash; is not of the Father but is of the world."
7421,7423,0,1John,2017,"And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever."
7422,7424,0,1John,2018,"Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour."
7423,7425,0,1John,2019,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us."
7424,7426,0,1John,2020,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things."
7425,7427,0,1John,2021,"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
7426,7428,0,1John,2022,Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.
7427,7429,0,1John,2023,"Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also."
7428,7430,0,1John,2024,"Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father."
7429,7431,0,1John,2025,"And this is the promise that He has promised us &ndash; eternal life."
7430,7432,0,1John,2026,These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you.
7431,7433,0,1John,2027,"But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him."
7432,7434,0,1John,2028,"And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming."
7433,7435,0,1John,2029,"If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him."
7434,7436,0,1John,3001,"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him."
7435,7437,0,1John,3002,"Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."
7436,7438,0,1John,3003,"And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure."
7437,7439,0,1John,3004,"Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness."
7438,7440,0,1John,3005,"And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin."
7439,7441,0,1John,3006,Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.
7440,7442,0,1John,3007,"Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous."
7441,7443,0,1John,3008,"He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil."
7442,7444,0,1John,3009,"Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God."
7443,7445,0,1John,3010,"In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother."
7444,7446,0,1John,3011,"For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,"
7445,7447,0,1John,3012,"not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother&rsquo;s righteous."
7446,7448,0,1John,3013,"Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you."
7447,7449,0,1John,3014,"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death."
7448,7450,0,1John,3015,"Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
7449,7451,0,1John,3016,"By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
7450,7452,0,1John,3017,"But whoever has this world&rsquo;s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
7451,7453,0,1John,3018,"My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."
7452,7454,0,1John,3019,"And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him."
7453,7455,0,1John,3020,"For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things."
7454,7456,0,1John,3021,"Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God."
7455,7457,0,1John,3022,"And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight."
7456,7458,0,1John,3023,"And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment."
7457,7459,0,1John,3024,"Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us."
7458,7460,0,1John,4001,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
7459,7461,0,1John,4002,"By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,"
7460,7462,0,1John,4003,"and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world."
7461,7463,0,1John,4004,"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."
7462,7464,0,1John,4005,"They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them."
7463,7465,0,1John,4006,"We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."
7464,7466,0,1John,4007,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God."
7465,7467,0,1John,4008,"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
7466,7468,0,1John,4009,"In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him."
7467,7469,0,1John,4010,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
7468,7470,0,1John,4011,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
7469,7471,0,1John,4012,"No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us."
7470,7472,0,1John,4013,"By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit."
7471,7473,0,1John,4014,And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.
7472,7474,0,1John,4015,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God."
7473,7475,0,1John,4016,"And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him."
7474,7476,0,1John,4017,"Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world."
7475,7477,0,1John,4018,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love."
7476,7478,0,1John,4019,We love Him because He first loved us.
7477,7479,0,1John,4020,"If someone says, &ldquo;I love God,&rdquo; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?"
7478,7480,0,1John,4021,And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.
7479,7481,0,1John,5001,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him."
7480,7482,0,1John,5002,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments."
7481,7483,0,1John,5003,"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome."
7482,7484,0,1John,5004,"For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world &ndash; our faith."
7483,7485,0,1John,5005,"Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
7484,7486,0,1John,5006,"This is He who came by water and blood &ndash; Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth."
7485,7487,0,1John,5007,"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."
7486,7488,0,1John,5008,"And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one."
7487,7489,0,1John,5009,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son."
7488,7490,0,1John,5010,"He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son."
7489,7491,0,1John,5011,"And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."
7490,7492,0,1John,5012,"He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life."
7491,7493,0,1John,5013,"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God."
7492,7494,0,1John,5014,"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
7493,7495,0,1John,5015,"And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him."
7494,7496,0,1John,5016,"If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin which does not lead to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I do not say that he should pray about that."
7495,7497,0,1John,5017,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death."
7496,7498,0,1John,5018,"We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him."
7497,7499,0,1John,5019,"We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one."
7498,7500,0,1John,5020,"And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."
7499,7501,0,1John,5021,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
7500,7502,0,2John,1001,"The Elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,"
7501,7503,0,2John,1002,because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:
7502,7504,0,2John,1003,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
7503,7505,0,2John,1004,"I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father."
7504,7506,0,2John,1005,"And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another."
7505,7507,0,2John,1006,"This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it."
7506,7508,0,2John,1007,For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
7507,7509,0,2John,1008,"Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward."
7508,7510,0,2John,1009,Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
7509,7511,0,2John,1010,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him;"
7510,7512,0,2John,1011,for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.
7511,7513,0,2John,1012,"Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
7512,7514,0,2John,1013,The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
7513,7515,0,3John,1001,"The Elder, to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth:"
7514,7516,0,3John,1002,"Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers."
7515,7517,0,3John,1003,"For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth."
7516,7518,0,3John,1004,I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
7517,7519,0,3John,1005,"Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers,"
7518,7520,0,3John,1006,"who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well,"
7519,7521,0,3John,1007,"because they went forth for His name&rsquo;s sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles."
7520,7522,0,3John,1008,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth."
7521,7523,0,3John,1009,"I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us."
7522,7524,0,3John,1010,"Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church."
7523,7525,0,3John,1011,"Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God."
7524,7526,0,3John,1012,"Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true."
7525,7527,0,3John,1013,"I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink;"
7526,7528,0,3John,1014,"but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
7527,7529,0,Jude,1001,"Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ:"
7528,7530,0,Jude,1002,"Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you."
7529,7531,0,Jude,1003,"Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints."
7530,7532,0,Jude,1004,"For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ."
7531,7533,0,Jude,1005,"But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe."
7532,7534,0,Jude,1006,"And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day;"
7533,7535,0,Jude,1007,"as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
7534,7536,0,Jude,1008,"Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries."
7535,7537,0,Jude,1009,"Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, &ldquo;The Lord rebuke you!&rdquo;"
7536,7538,0,Jude,1010,"But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves."
7537,7539,0,Jude,1011,"Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah."
7538,7540,0,Jude,1012,"These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots;"
7539,7541,0,Jude,1013,"raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
7540,7542,0,Jude,1014,"Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints,"
7541,7543,0,Jude,1015,"to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.&rdquo;"
7542,7544,0,Jude,1016,"These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage."
7543,7545,0,Jude,1017,"But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
7544,7546,0,Jude,1018,how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts.
7545,7547,0,Jude,1019,"These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit."
7546,7548,0,Jude,1020,"But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,"
7547,7549,0,Jude,1021,"keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
7548,7550,0,Jude,1022,"And on some have compassion, making a distinction;"
7549,7551,0,Jude,1023,"but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh."
7550,7552,0,Jude,1024,"Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,"
7551,7553,0,Jude,1025,"To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen."
7552,1982,0,Luke,5019,"And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus."
7553,17626,1,Joel,2013,"So rend your heart, and not your garments; return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; and He relents from doing harm. "
7554,17627,1,Joel,2014,"Who knows if He will turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind Him &ndash; a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God? "
7555,17628,1,Joel,2015,"Blow the trumpet in Zion, consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly; "
7556,17629,1,Joel,2016,"gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children and nursing babes; let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, and the bride from her dressing room. "
7557,17630,1,Joel,2017,"Let the priests, who minister to the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar; let them say, &ldquo;Spare Your people, O Lord, and do not give Your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, &lsquo;Where is their God?&rsquo;&rdquo; "
7558,17631,1,Joel,2018,"Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, and pity His people. "
7559,17632,1,Joel,2019,"The Lord will answer and say to His people, &ldquo;Behold, I will send you grain and new wine and oil, and you will be satisfied by them; I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations. "
7560,17633,1,Joel,2020,"But I will remove far from you the northern army, and will drive him away into a barren and desolate land, with his face toward the eastern sea and his back toward the western sea; His stench will come up, and his foul odor will rise, because he has done monstrous things.&rdquo;"
7561,17634,1,Joel,2021,"Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the Lord has done marvelous things! "
7562,17635,1,Joel,2022,"Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field; for the open pastures are springing up, and the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their strength. "
7563,17636,1,Joel,2023,"Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God; for He has given you the former rain faithfully, and He will cause the rain to come down for you &ndash; the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month."

7566,17642,1,Joel,2029,and also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
7567,17643,1,Joel,2030,And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
7568,17646,1,Joel,3001,"For behold, in those days and at that time, when I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,"
7569,17647,1,Joel,3002,"I will also gather all nations, and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of My people, My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations; they have also divided up My land."
7570,17648,1,Joel,3003,"They have cast lots for My people, have given a boy as payment for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink."
7571,17649,1,Joel,3004,"Indeed, what have you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Philistia? Will you retaliate against Me? But if you retaliate against Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your retaliation upon your own head;"

7746,3988,1,Num,10005,"When you sound the advance, the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey."
7747,3989,1,Num,10006,"When you sound the advance the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall begin their journey; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys."
7748,3990,1,Num,10007,"And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the advance."
7749,3991,1,Num,10008,"The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations."
7750,3992,1,Num,10009,"&ldquo;When you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God, and you will be saved from your enemies."
7751,3993,1,Num,10010,"Also in the day of your gladness, in your appointed feasts, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I am the LORD your God.&rdquo;"
7752,3994,1,Num,10011,"Now it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony."
7753,3995,1,Num,10012,"And the children of Israel set out from the Wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; then the cloud settled down in the Wilderness of Paran."
7754,3996,1,Num,10013,So they started out for the first time according to the command of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
7755,3997,1,Num,10014,"The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab."
7756,3998,1,Num,10015,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
7757,3999,1,Num,10016,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
7758,4000,1,Num,10017,"Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle."
7759,4001,1,Num,10018,"And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur."
7760,4002,1,Num,10019,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
7761,4003,1,Num,10020,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
7762,4004,1,Num,10021,"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. (The tabernacle would be prepared for their arrival.)"
7763,4005,1,Num,10022,"And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies; over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud."
7764,4006,1,Num,10023,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
7765,4007,1,Num,10024,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
7766,4008,1,Num,10025,"Then the standard of the camp of the children of Dan (the rear guard of all the camps) set out according to their armies; over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai."
7767,4009,1,Num,10026,Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
7768,4010,1,Num,10027,And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
7769,4011,1,Num,10028,"Thus was the order of march of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they began their journey."
7770,4012,1,Num,10029,"Now Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, &ldquo;We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, &lsquo;I will give it to you.&rsquo; Come with us, and we will treat you well; for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.&rdquo;"
7771,4013,1,Num,10030,"And he said to him, &ldquo;I will not go, but I will depart to my own land and to my relatives.&rdquo;"
7772,4014,1,Num,10031,"So Moses said, &ldquo;Please do not leave, inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes."
7773,4015,1,Num,10032,"And it shall be, if you go with us &ndash; indeed it shall be &ndash; that whatever good the LORD will do to us, the same we will do to you.&rdquo;"
7774,4016,1,Num,10033,"So they departed from the mountain of the LORD on a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them for the three days&rsquo; journey, to search out a resting place for them."
7775,4017,1,Num,10034,And the cloud of the LORD was above them by day when they went out from the camp.
7776,4018,1,Num,10035,"So it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said: &ldquo;Rise up, O LORD! Let Your enemies be scattered, And let those who hate You flee before You.&rdquo;"
7777,4019,1,Num,10036,"And when it rested, he said: &ldquo; Return, O LORD, To the many thousands of Israel.&rdquo;"
7778,4020,1,Num,11001,"Now when the people complained, it displeased the LORD; for the LORD heard it, and His anger was aroused. So the fire of the LORD burned among them, and consumed some in the outskirts of the camp."
7779,4021,1,Num,11002,"Then the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched."
7780,4022,1,Num,11003,"So he called the name of the place Taberah,[a] because the fire of the LORD had burned among them."
7781,4023,1,Num,11004,"Now the mixed multitude who were among them yielded to intense craving; so the children of Israel also wept again and said: &ldquo;Who will give us meat to eat?"
7782,4024,1,Num,11005,"We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;"
7783,4025,1,Num,11006,"but now our whole being is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes!&rdquo;"
7784,4026,1,Num,11007,"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its color like the color of bdellium."
7785,4027,1,Num,11008,"The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil."
7786,4028,1,Num,11009,"And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it."
7787,4029,1,Num,11010,"Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was greatly aroused; Moses also was displeased."
7788,4030,1,Num,11011,"So Moses said to the LORD, &ldquo;Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all these people on me?"
7789,4031,1,Num,11012,"Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to me, &lsquo;Carry them in your bosom, as a guardian carries a nursing child,&rsquo; to the land which You swore to their fathers?"
7790,4032,1,Num,11013,"Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep all over me, saying, &lsquo;Give us meat, that we may eat.&rsquo;"
7791,4033,1,Num,11014,"I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me."
7792,4034,1,Num,11015,"If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now &ndash; if I have found favor in Your sight &ndash; and do not let me see my wretchedness!&rdquo;"
7793,4035,1,Num,11016,"So the LORD said to Moses: &ldquo;Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tabernacle of meeting, that they may stand there with you."
7794,4036,1,Num,11017,"Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone."
7795,4037,1,Num,11018,"Then you shall say to the people, &lsquo;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, &ldquo;Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.&rdquo; Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat."
7796,4038,1,Num,11019,"You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,"
7797,4039,1,Num,11020,"but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, &ldquo;Why did we ever come up out of Egypt?&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
7798,4040,1,Num,11021,"And Moses said, &ldquo;The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand men on foot; yet You have said, &lsquo;I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month.&rsquo;"
7799,4041,1,Num,11022,"Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide enough for them?&rdquo;"
7800,4042,1,Num,11023,"And the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Has the LORD&rsquo;s arm been shortened? Now you shall see whether what I say will happen to you or not.&rdquo;"
7801,4043,1,Num,11024,"So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tabernacle."
7802,4044,1,Num,11025,"Then the LORD came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again."
7803,4045,1,Num,11026,"But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those listed, but who had not gone out to the tabernacle; yet they prophesied in the camp."
7804,4046,1,Num,11027,"And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, &ldquo;Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.&rdquo;"
7805,4047,1,Num,11028,"So Joshua the son of Nun, Moses&rsquo; assistant, one of his choice men, answered and said, &ldquo;Moses my lord, forbid them!&rdquo;"
7806,4048,1,Num,11029,"Then Moses said to him, &ldquo;Are you zealous for my sake? Oh, that all the LORD&rsquo;s people were prophets and that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!&rdquo;"
7807,4049,1,Num,11030,"And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel."
7808,4050,1,Num,11031,"Now a wind went out from the LORD, and it brought quail from the sea and left them fluttering near the camp, about a day&rsquo;s journey on this side and about a day&rsquo;s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the ground."
7809,4051,1,Num,11032,"And the people stayed up all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers); and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp."
7810,4052,1,Num,11033,"But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was aroused against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague."
7811,4053,1,Num,11034,"So he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving."
7812,4054,1,Num,11035,"From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth."
7813,4055,1,Num,12001,"Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for he had married an Ethiopian woman."
7814,4056,1,Num,12002,"So they said, &ldquo;Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also?&rdquo; And the LORD heard it."
7815,4057,1,Num,12003,"(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all men who were on the face of the earth.)"
7816,4058,1,Num,12004,"Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, &ldquo;Come out, you three, to the tabernacle of meeting!&rdquo; So the three came out."
7817,4059,1,Num,12005,"Then the LORD came down in the pillar of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both went forward."
7818,4060,1,Num,12006,"Then He said, &ldquo;Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream."
7819,4061,1,Num,12007,"Not so with My servant Moses; He is faithful in all My house."
7820,4062,1,Num,12008,"I speak with him face to face, Even plainly, and not in dark sayings; And he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses?&rdquo;"
7821,4063,1,Num,12009,"So the anger of the LORD was aroused against them, and He departed."
7822,5231,1,Deut,11014,"then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. "

7826,5235,1,Deut,11018,"Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes."
7827,5236,1,Deut,11019,"You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up."

7829,5238,1,Deut,11021,"that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, like the days of the heavens above the earth. "
7830,5239,1,Deut,11022,"For if you carefully keep all these commandments which I command you to do &ndash; to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him &ndash; "

7832,5241,1,Deut,11024,"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the Western Sea, shall be your territory. "
7833,5242,1,Deut,11025,"No man shall be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, just as He has said to you. "
7834,5243,1,Deut,11026,"Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: "

7837,5246,1,Deut,11029,"Now it shall be, when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. "
7838,5247,1,Deut,11030,"Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the terebinth trees of Moreh? "

8026,6589,1,Judg,4011,"Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim, which is beside Kedesh. "
8027,6590,1,Judg,4012,And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
8028,6591,1,Judg,4013,"So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon. "
8029,6592,1,Judg,4014,"Then Deborah said to Barak, &ldquo;Up! For this is the day in which the Lord has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the Lord gone out before you?&rdquo; So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. "
8030,6593,1,Judg,4015,"And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot. "
8031,6594,1,Judg,4016,"But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left. "
8032,6595,1,Judg,4017,"However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. "
8033,6596,1,Judg,4018,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, &ldquo;Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.&rdquo; And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket. "
8034,6597,1,Judg,4019,"Then he said to her, &ldquo;Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.&rdquo; So she opened a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him. "
8035,6598,1,Judg,4020,"And he said to her, &ldquo;Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, &lsquo;Is there any man here?&rsquo; you shall say, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
8036,6599,1,Judg,4021,"Then Jael, Heber&rsquo;s wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. "
8037,6600,1,Judg,4022,"And then, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, &ldquo;Come, I will show you the man whom you seek.&rdquo; And when he went into her tent, there lay Sisera, dead with the peg in his temple. "
8038,6601,1,Judg,4023,So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel. 
8039,6602,1,Judg,4024,"And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. "
8040,6603,1,Judg,5001,"Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying: "
8041,6604,1,Judg,5002,"When leaders lead in Israel, When the people willingly offer themselves, Bless the Lord! "
8042,6605,1,Judg,5003,"Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I, even I, will sing to the Lord; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel. "
8043,6606,1,Judg,5004,"Lord, when You went out from Seir, When You marched from the field of Edom, The earth trembled and the heavens poured, The clouds also poured water; "
8044,6607,1,Judg,5005,"The mountains gushed before the Lord, This Sinai, before the Lord God of Israel. "
8045,6608,1,Judg,5006,"In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were deserted, And the travelers walked along the byways. "
8046,6609,1,Judg,5007,"Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Arose a mother in Israel. "
8047,6610,1,Judg,5008,"They chose new gods; Then there was war in the gates; Not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. "
8048,6611,1,Judg,5009,My heart is with the rulers of Israel Who offered themselves willingly with the people. Bless the Lord! 
8049,6612,1,Judg,5010,"Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, Who sit in judges&rsquo; attire, And who walk along the road. "
8050,6613,1,Judg,5011,"Far from the noise of the archers, among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous acts of the Lord, The righteous acts for His villagers in Israel; Then the people of the Lord shall go down to the gates. "
8051,6614,1,Judg,5012,"Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and lead your captives away, O son of Abinoam! "
8052,6615,1,Judg,5013,"Then the survivors came down, the people against the nobles; The Lord came down for me against the mighty. "
8053,6616,1,Judg,5014,"From Ephraim were those whose roots were in Amalek. After you, Benjamin, with your peoples, From Machir rulers came down, And from Zebulun those who bear the recruiter&rsquo;s staff. "
8054,6617,1,Judg,5015,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As Issachar, so was Barak Sent into the valley under his command; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart. "
8055,6618,1,Judg,5016,"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the pipings for the flocks? The divisions of Reuben have great searchings of heart. "
8056,6619,1,Judg,5017,"Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, And why did Dan remain on ships? Asher continued at the seashore, And stayed by his inlets. "
8057,6620,1,Judg,5018,"Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to the point of death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield. "
8058,6621,1,Judg,5019,"The kings came and fought, Then the kings of Canaan fought In Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoils of silver. "
8059,6622,1,Judg,5020,"They fought from the heavens; The stars from their courses fought against Sisera. "
8060,6623,1,Judg,5021,"The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent of Kishon. O my soul, march on in strength! "
8061,6624,1,Judg,5022,"Then the horses&rsquo; hooves pounded, The galloping, galloping of his steeds. "
8062,6625,1,Judg,5023,"Curse Meroz,&rsquo; said the angel of the Lord, &lsquo;Curse its inhabitants bitterly, Because they did not come to the help of the Lord, To the help of the Lord against the mighty.&rsquo; "
8063,6626,1,Judg,5024,"Most blessed among women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed is she among women in tents. "
8064,6627,1,Judg,5025,"He asked for water, she gave milk; She brought out cream in a lordly bowl. "
8065,6628,1,Judg,5026,"She stretched her hand to the tent peg, Her right hand to the workmen&rsquo;s hammer; She pounded Sisera, she pierced his head, She split and struck through his temple. "
8066,6629,1,Judg,5027,"At her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; At her feet he sank, he fell; Where he sank, there he fell dead. "
8067,6630,1,Judg,5028,"The mother of Sisera looked through the window, And cried out through the lattice, &lsquo;Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarries the clatter of his chariots?&rsquo; "
8068,6631,1,Judg,5029,"Her wisest ladies answered her, Yes, she answered herself, "
8069,6632,1,Judg,5030,"&rsquo;Are they not finding and dividing the spoil: To every man a girl or two; For Sisera, plunder of dyed garments, Plunder of garments embroidered and dyed, Two pieces of dyed embroidery for the neck of the looter?&rsquo; "
8070,6633,1,Judg,5031,"Thus let all Your enemies perish, O Lord! But let those who love Him be like the sun When it comes out in full strength. So the land had rest for forty years. "
8071,6634,1,Judg,6001,"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years, "
8072,6635,1,Judg,6002,"and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains. "
8073,6636,1,Judg,6003,"So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. "
8074,6637,1,Judg,6004,"Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey. "
8075,6638,1,Judg,6005,"For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it. "
8076,6639,1,Judg,6006,"So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord. "
8077,6640,1,Judg,6007,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord because of the Midianites, "
8078,6641,1,Judg,6008,"that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord God of Israel: &lsquo;I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage; "
8079,6642,1,Judg,6009,"and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. "
8080,6643,1,Judg,6010,"Also I said to you, &ldquo;I am the Lord your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.&rdquo; But you have not obeyed My voice.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
8081,6644,1,Judg,6011,"Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites. "
8082,6645,1,Judg,6012,"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, &ldquo;The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor!&rdquo; "
8083,6646,1,Judg,6013,"Gideon said to Him, &ldquo;O my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, &lsquo;Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?&rsquo; But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.&rdquo; "
8084,6647,1,Judg,6014,"Then the Lord turned to him and said, &ldquo;Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?&rdquo; "
8085,6648,1,Judg,6015,"So he said to Him, &ldquo;O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; "
8086,6649,1,Judg,6016,"And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man.&rdquo; "
8087,6650,1,Judg,6017,"Then he said to Him, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me. "
8088,6651,1,Judg,6018,"Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;I will wait until you come back.&rdquo; "
8089,6652,1,Judg,6019,"So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them. "
8090,6653,1,Judg,6020,"The Angel of God said to him, &ldquo;Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.&rdquo; And he did so. "
8091,6654,1,Judg,6021,"Then the Angel of the Lord put out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. "
8092,6655,1,Judg,6022,"Now Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord. So Gideon said, &ldquo;Alas, O Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face.&rdquo; "
8093,6656,1,Judg,6023,"Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die.&rdquo; "
8094,6657,1,Judg,6024,"So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and called it The-Lord-Is-Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. "
8095,6658,1,Judg,6025,"Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Take your father&rsquo;s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the wooden image that is beside it; "
8096,6659,1,Judg,6026,"and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down.&rdquo; "
8097,6660,1,Judg,6027,"So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had said to him. But because he feared his father&rsquo;s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night. "
8098,6661,1,Judg,6028,"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built. "
8099,6662,1,Judg,6029,"So they said to one another, &ldquo;Who has done this thing?&rdquo; And when they had inquired and asked, they said, &ldquo;Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.&rdquo; "
8100,6663,1,Judg,6030,"Then the men of the city said to Joash, &ldquo;Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it.&rdquo; "
8101,6664,1,Judg,6031,"But Joash said to all who stood against him, &ldquo;Would you plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down!&rdquo; "
8102,6665,1,Judg,6032,"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, &ldquo;Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar.&rdquo; "
8103,6666,1,Judg,6033,"Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. "
8104,6667,1,Judg,6034,"But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him. "
8105,6668,1,Judg,6035,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. "
8106,6669,1,Judg,6036,"So Gideon said to God, &ldquo;If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said &ndash; "
8107,6670,1,Judg,6037,"look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said.&rdquo; "
8108,6671,1,Judg,6038,"And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. "
8109,6672,1,Judg,6039,"Then Gideon said to God, &ldquo;Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.&rdquo; "
8110,6673,1,Judg,6040,"And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground. "
8111,6674,1,Judg,7001,"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the well of Harod, so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley. "
8112,6675,1,Judg,7002,"And the Lord said to Gideon, &ldquo;The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel claim glory for itself against Me, saying, &lsquo;My own hand has saved me.&rsquo; "
8113,6676,1,Judg,7003,"Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, &lsquo;Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from Mount Gilead.&rsquo; &ldquo; And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained. "
8114,6677,1,Judg,7004,"But the Lord said to Gideon, &ldquo;The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. Then it will be, that of whom I say to you, &lsquo;This one shall go with you,&rsquo; the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, &lsquo;This one shall not go with you,&rsquo; the same shall not go.&rdquo; "
8115,6678,1,Judg,7005,"So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, &ldquo;Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.&rdquo; "
8116,6679,1,Judg,7006,"And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people got down on their knees to drink water. "
8117,6680,1,Judg,7007,"Then the Lord said to Gideon, &ldquo;By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.&rdquo; "
8118,6681,1,Judg,7008,"So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley. "
8119,6682,1,Judg,7009,"It happened on the same night that the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Arise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand. "
8120,6683,1,Judg,7010,"But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant, "
8121,6684,1,Judg,7011,"and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.&rdquo; Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp. "
8122,6685,1,Judg,7012,"Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the people of the East, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore in multitude. "
8123,6686,1,Judg,7013,"And when Gideon had come, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, &ldquo;I have had a dream: To my surprise, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent collapsed.&rdquo; "
8124,6687,1,Judg,7014,"Then his companion answered and said, &ldquo;This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.&rdquo; "
8125,6688,1,Judg,7015,"And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, &ldquo;Arise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.&rdquo; "
8126,6689,1,Judg,7016,"Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet into every man&rsquo;s hand, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers. "
8127,9122,1,3Kg,12029,"And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. "
8128,9123,1,3Kg,12030,"Now this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan. "
8129,9124,1,3Kg,12031,"He made shrines on the high places, and made priests from every class of people, who were not of the sons of Levi. "
8130,9125,1,3Kg,12032,"Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made. "
8131,9126,1,3Kg,12033,"So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised in his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense. "
8132,9127,1,3Kg,13001,"And behold, a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the word of the Lord, and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. "
8133,9128,1,3Kg,13002,"Then he cried out against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, &ldquo;O altar, altar! Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Behold, a child, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men&rsquo;s bones shall be burned on you.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
8134,9129,1,3Kg,13003,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, &ldquo;This is the sign which the Lord has spoken: Surely the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.&rdquo; "
8135,9130,1,3Kg,13004,"So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, &ldquo;Arrest him!&rdquo; Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself. "
8136,9131,1,3Kg,13005,"The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord. "
8137,9132,1,3Kg,13006,"Then the king answered and said to the man of God, &ldquo;Please entreat the favor of the Lord your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.&rdquo; So the man of God entreated the Lord, and the king&rsquo;s hand was restored to him, and became as before. "
8138,9133,1,3Kg,13007,"Then the king said to the man of God, &ldquo;Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.&rdquo; "
8139,9134,1,3Kg,13008,"But the man of God said to the king, &ldquo;If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. "
8140,9135,1,3Kg,13009,"For so it was commanded me by the word of the Lord, saying, &lsquo;You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.&rsquo; &ldquo; "

8301,191,1,Gen,8007,"Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth."
8302,192,1,Gen,8008,"He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground."
8303,193,1,Gen,8009,"But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself."
8304,194,1,Gen,8010,"And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark."
8305,195,1,Gen,8011,"Then the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; and Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth."
8306,196,1,Gen,8012,"So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore."
8307,197,1,Gen,8013,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and indeed the surface of the ground was dry."
8308,198,1,Gen,8014,"And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried."
8309,199,1,Gen,8015,"Then God spoke to Noah, saying,"
8310,200,1,Gen,8016,"&ldquo;Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons&rsquo; wives with you."

8313,203,1,Gen,8019,"Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, and whatever creeps on the earth, according to their families, went out of the ark."
8314,204,1,Gen,8020,"Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
8315,205,1,Gen,8021,"And the Lord smelled a soothing aroma. Then the Lord said in His heart, &ldquo;I will never again curse the ground for man&rsquo;s sake, although the imagination of man&rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done."
8316,206,1,Gen,8022,"While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, winter and summer, and day and night shall not cease.&rdquo;"
8317,207,1,Gen,9001,"So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. "

8320,210,1,Gen,9004,"But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."
8321,211,1,Gen,9005,"Surely for your lifeblood I will demand a reckoning; from the hand of every beast I will require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand of every man&rsquo;s brother I will require the life of man."
8322,212,1,Gen,9006,"Whoever sheds man&rsquo;s blood, by man his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God He made man."

8330,220,1,Gen,9014,"It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud;"

8335,225,1,Gen,9019,"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated."
8336,226,1,Gen,9020,"And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard."
8337,227,1,Gen,9021,"Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent."
8338,228,1,Gen,9022,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside."
8339,229,1,Gen,9023,"But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father&rsquo;s nakedness."
8340,230,1,Gen,9024,"So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him."
8341,231,1,Gen,9025,"Then he said: &ldquo;Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brethren.&rdquo;"

8728,278,1,Gen,11011,"After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
8729,279,1,Gen,11012,"Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Salah."
8730,280,1,Gen,11013,"After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters."
8731,281,1,Gen,11014,"Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber."

8740,290,1,Gen,11023,"After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters."
8741,291,1,Gen,11024,"Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah."
8742,292,1,Gen,11025,"After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters."
8743,293,1,Gen,11026,"Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
8744,294,1,Gen,11027,"This is the genealogy of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran begot Lot."
8745,295,1,Gen,11028,"And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
8746,296,1,Gen,11029,"Then Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram&rsquo;s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor&rsquo;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah."
8747,297,1,Gen,11030,"But Sarai was barren; she had no child."
8748,298,1,Gen,11031,"And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram&rsquo;s wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran and dwelt there."
8749,299,1,Gen,11032,"So the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran."
8750,300,1,Gen,12001,"Now the Lord had said to Abram: &ldquo;Get out of your country, from your family and from your father&rsquo;s house, to a land that I will show you. "
8751,46,1,Gen,2015,Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.
8752,47,1,Gen,2016,"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, &ldquo;Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;"
8753,48,1,Gen,2017,"&ldquo;but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo;"
8754,49,1,Gen,2018,"And the Lord God said, &ldquo;It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.&rdquo;"
8755,50,1,Gen,2019,"Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name."
8756,51,1,Gen,2020,"So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him."
8757,52,1,Gen,2021,"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place."
8758,53,1,Gen,2022,"Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man."
8759,54,1,Gen,2023,"And Adam said: &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.&rdquo;"
8760,55,1,Gen,2024,"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
8761,56,1,Gen,2025,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
8762,57,1,Gen,3001,"Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, &ldquo;Has God indeed said, &lsquo;You shall not eat of every tree of the garden&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
8763,58,1,Gen,3002,"And the woman said to the serpent, &ldquo;We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden;"
8764,59,1,Gen,3003,"&ldquo;but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, &lsquo;You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
8765,60,1,Gen,3004,"Then the serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;You will not surely die."
8766,61,1,Gen,3005,"&ldquo;For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo;"
8767,62,1,Gen,3006,"So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate."
8768,63,1,Gen,3007,"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings."
8769,64,1,Gen,3008,"And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden."
8770,65,1,Gen,3009,"Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;"
8771,66,1,Gen,3010,"So he said, &ldquo;I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.&rdquo;"
8772,67,1,Gen,3011,"And He said, &ldquo;Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?&rdquo;"
8773,68,1,Gen,3012,"Then the man said, &ldquo;The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.&rdquo;"
8774,69,1,Gen,3013,"And the Lord God said to the woman, &ldquo;What is this you have done?&rdquo; The woman said, &ldquo;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&rdquo;"
8775,70,1,Gen,3014,"So the Lord God said to the serpent: &ldquo;Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all cattle, and more than every beast of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. "
8776,71,1,Gen,3015,"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.&rdquo;"
8777,72,1,Gen,3016,"To the woman He said: &ldquo;I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.&rdquo;"
8778,73,1,Gen,3017,"Then to Adam He said, &ldquo;Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, &lsquo;You shall not eat of it&rsquo;: &ldquo;Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life."
8779,74,1,Gen,3018,"Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the herb of the field."
8780,75,1,Gen,3019,"In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground. For out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.&rdquo;"
8781,76,1,Gen,3020,"And Adam called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."
8782,77,1,Gen,3021,"Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed them."
8783,78,1,Gen,3022,"Then the Lord God said, &ldquo;Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever&rdquo; &ndash; "
8784,79,1,Gen,3023,therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.
8785,80,1,Gen,3024,"So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life."
8786,81,1,Gen,4001,"Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, &ldquo;I have acquired a man from the Lord.&rdquo;"
8787,82,1,Gen,4002,"Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
8788,83,1,Gen,4003,And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord.
8789,84,1,Gen,4004,"Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering,"
8790,85,1,Gen,4005,"but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell."
8791,86,1,Gen,4006,"So the Lord said to Cain, &ldquo;Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?"
8792,87,1,Gen,4007,"If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.&rdquo;"
8793,88,1,Gen,4008,"Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."
8794,89,1,Gen,4009,"Then the Lord said to Cain, &ldquo;Where is Abel your brother?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I do not know. Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo;"
8795,90,1,Gen,4010,"And He said, &ldquo;What have you done? The voice of your brother&rsquo;s blood cries out to Me from the ground."
8796,91,1,Gen,4011,"So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&rsquo;s blood from your hand."
8797,92,1,Gen,4012,"When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.&rdquo;"
8798,93,1,Gen,4013,"And Cain said to the Lord, &ldquo;My punishment is greater than I can bear!"
8799,94,1,Gen,4014,"Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.&rdquo;"
8800,95,1,Gen,4015,"And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.&rdquo; And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him."
8801,96,1,Gen,4016,Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.
8802,97,1,Gen,4017,"And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son &ndash; Enoch."
8803,98,1,Gen,4018,"To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech."
8804,99,1,Gen,4019,"Then Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah."
8805,100,1,Gen,4020,And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
8806,101,1,Gen,4021,"His brother&rsquo;s name was Jubal. He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute."
8807,102,1,Gen,4022,"And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah."
8808,103,1,Gen,4023,"Then Lamech said to his wives: &ldquo;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me."
8809,104,1,Gen,4024,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.&rdquo;"
8810,105,1,Gen,4025,"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, &ldquo;For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.&rdquo;"
8811,106,1,Gen,4026,"And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on the name of the Lord."
8812,107,1,Gen,5001,"This is the book of the genealogy of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God."
8813,108,1,Gen,5002,"He created them male and female, and blessed them and called them Mankind in the day they were created."
8814,109,1,Gen,5003,"And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth."
8815,110,1,Gen,5004,"After he begot Seth, the days of Adam were eight hundred years; and he had sons and daughters."
8816,111,1,Gen,5005,"So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died."
8817,112,1,Gen,5006,"Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh."
8818,113,1,Gen,5007,"After he begot Enosh, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters."
8819,114,1,Gen,5008,"So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died."
8820,115,1,Gen,5009,"Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan."
8821,116,1,Gen,5010,"After he begot Cainan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and had sons and daughters."
8822,117,1,Gen,5011,"So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died."
8823,118,1,Gen,5012,"Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel."
8824,119,1,Gen,5013,"After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters."
8825,120,1,Gen,5014,"So all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died."
8826,121,1,Gen,5015,"Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared."
8827,122,1,Gen,5016,"After he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters."
8828,123,1,Gen,5017,"So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died."
8829,124,1,Gen,5018,"Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch."
8830,125,1,Gen,5019,"After he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters."
8831,126,1,Gen,5020,"So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died."
8832,127,1,Gen,5021,"Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah."
8833,128,1,Gen,5022,"After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and had sons and daughters."
8834,129,1,Gen,5023,So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
8835,130,1,Gen,5024,"And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him."
8836,131,1,Gen,5025,"Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech."
8837,2459,1,Exod,32020,"Then he took the calf which they had made, burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder; and he scattered it on the water and made the children of Israel drink it."
8838,2460,1,Exod,32021,"And Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?&rdquo;"
8839,2461,1,Exod,32022,"So Aaron said, &ldquo;Do not let the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil."
8840,2462,1,Exod,32023,"&ldquo;For they said to me, &lsquo;Make us gods that shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.&rsquo;"
8841,2463,1,Exod,32024,"&ldquo;And I said to them, &lsquo;Whoever has any gold, let them break it off.&rsquo; So they gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.&rdquo;"
8842,2464,1,Exod,32025,"Now when Moses saw that the people were unrestrained (for Aaron had not restrained them, to their shame among their enemies),"
8843,2465,1,Exod,32026,"then Moses stood in the entrance of the camp, and said, &ldquo;Whoever is on the Lord&rsquo;s side &ndash; come to me!&rdquo; And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him."
8844,2466,1,Exod,32027,"And he said to them, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord God of Israel: &lsquo;Let every man put his sword on his side, and go in and out from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and let every man kill his brother, every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
8845,2467,1,Exod,32028,So the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And about three thousand men of the people fell that day.
8846,2468,1,Exod,32029,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, that He may bestow on you a blessing this day, for every man has opposed his son and his brother.&rdquo;"
8847,2469,1,Exod,32030,"Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses said to the people, &ldquo;You have committed a great sin. So now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.&rdquo;"
8848,2470,1,Exod,32031,"Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Oh, these people have committed a great sin, and have made for themselves a god of gold!"
8849,2471,1,Exod,32032,"&ldquo;Yet now, if You will forgive their sin &ndash; but if not, I pray, blot me out of Your book which You have written.&rdquo;"
8850,2472,1,Exod,32033,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book."
8851,2473,1,Exod,32034,"&ldquo;Now therefore, go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit for punishment, I will visit punishment upon them for their sin.&rdquo;"
8852,2474,1,Exod,32035,So the Lord plagued the people because of what they did with the calf which Aaron made.
8853,2475,1,Exod,33001,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Depart and go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, &lsquo;To your descendants I will give it.&rsquo;"
8854,2476,1,Exod,33002,"&ldquo;And I will send My Angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite."
8855,2477,1,Exod,33003,"&ldquo;Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.&rdquo;"
8856,2478,1,Exod,33004,"And when the people heard this bad news, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments."
8857,2479,1,Exod,33005,"For the Lord had said to Moses, &ldquo;Say to the children of Israel, &lsquo;You are a stiff-necked people. I could come up into your midst in one moment and consume you. Now therefore, take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
8858,2480,1,Exod,33006,So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.
8859,2481,1,Exod,33007,"Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of meeting. And it came to pass that everyone who sought the Lord went out to the tabernacle of meeting which was outside the camp."
8860,2482,1,Exod,33008,"So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle."
8861,2483,1,Exod,33009,"And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses."
8862,2484,1,Exod,33010,"All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door, and all the people rose and worshiped, each man in his tent door."
8863,2485,1,Exod,33011,"So the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle."
8864,2486,1,Exod,33012,"Then Moses said to the Lord, &ldquo;See, You say to me, &lsquo;Bring up this people.&rsquo; But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, &lsquo;I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight.&rsquo;"
8865,2487,1,Exod,33013,"&ldquo;Now therefore, I pray, if I have found grace in Your sight, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find grace in Your sight. And consider that this nation is Your people.&rdquo;"
8866,2488,1,Exod,33014,"And He said, &ldquo;My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.&rdquo;"
8867,2489,1,Exod,33015,"Then he said to Him, &ldquo;If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here."
8868,2490,1,Exod,33016,"&ldquo;For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight, except You go with us? So we shall be separate, Your people and I, from all the people who are upon the face of the earth.&rdquo;"
8869,2491,1,Exod,33017,"So the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.&rdquo;"
8870,2492,1,Exod,33018,"And he said, &ldquo;Please, show me Your glory.&rdquo;"
8871,2493,1,Exod,33019,"Then He said, &ldquo;I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.&rdquo;"
8872,2494,1,Exod,33020,"But He said, &ldquo;You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.&rdquo;"
8873,2495,1,Exod,33021,"And the Lord said, &ldquo;Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock."
8874,2496,1,Exod,33022,"&ldquo;So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by."
8875,2497,1,Exod,33023,"&ldquo;Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.&rdquo;"
8876,2498,1,Exod,34001,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke."
8877,2499,1,Exod,34002,"&ldquo;So be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain."
8878,2500,1,Exod,34003,"&ldquo;And no man shall come up with you, and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain; let neither flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.&rdquo;"
8879,2501,1,Exod,34004,"So he cut two tablets of stone like the first ones. Then Moses rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone."
8880,2502,1,Exod,34005,"Now the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord."
8881,2503,1,Exod,34006,"And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, &ldquo;The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth,"
8882,2504,1,Exod,34007,"&ldquo;keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children&rsquo;s children to the third and the fourth generation.&rdquo;"
8883,2505,1,Exod,34008,"So Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped."
8884,2506,1,Exod,34009,"Then he said, &ldquo;If now I have found grace in Your sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray, go among us, even though we are a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance.&rdquo;"
8885,2507,1,Exod,34010,"And He said: &ldquo;Behold, I make a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the Lord. For it is an awesome thing that I will "
8886,2508,1,Exod,34011,"&ldquo;Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite."
8887,2509,1,Exod,34012,"&ldquo;Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst."
8888,2510,1,Exod,34013,"&ldquo;But you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and cut down their wooden images"
8889,2511,1,Exod,34014,"&ldquo;(for you shall worship no other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),"
8890,2512,1,Exod,34015,"&ldquo;lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot with their gods and make sacrifice to their gods, and one of them invites you and you eat of his sacrifice,"

8892,2514,1,Exod,34017,"&ldquo;You shall make no molded gods for yourselves."
8893,2515,1,Exod,34018,"&ldquo;The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt."
8894,2516,1,Exod,34019,"&ldquo;All that open the womb are Mine, and every male firstborn among your livestock, whether ox or sheep."
8895,2517,1,Exod,34020,"&ldquo;But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you will not redeem him, then you shall break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty-handed."
8896,2518,1,Exod,34021,"&ldquo;Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest."
8897,2519,1,Exod,34022,"&ldquo;And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year&rsquo;s end."
8898,2520,1,Exod,34023,"&ldquo;Three times in the year all your men shall appear before the Lord, the Lord God of Israel."
8899,2521,1,Exod,34024,"&ldquo;For I will cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year."
8900,2522,1,Exod,34025,"&ldquo;You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning."
8901,2523,1,Exod,34026,"&ldquo;The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;"
8902,2524,1,Exod,34027,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Write these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.&rdquo;"
8903,2525,1,Exod,34028,"So he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments."
8904,2526,1,Exod,34029,"Now it was so, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the Testimony were in Moses&rsquo; hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him."
8905,2527,1,Exod,34030,"So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him."
8906,2528,1,Exod,34031,"Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them."
8907,2529,1,Exod,34032,"Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them as commandments all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai."
8908,2530,1,Exod,34033,"And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face."
8909,2531,1,Exod,34034,"But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would take the veil off until he came out; and he would come out and speak to the children of Israel whatever he had been commanded."
8910,2532,1,Exod,34035,"And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses&rsquo; face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him."
8911,2533,1,Exod,35001,"Then Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, &ldquo;These are the words which the Lord has commanded you to do:"
8912,2534,1,Exod,35002,"&ldquo;Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death."
8913,2535,1,Exod,35003,"&ldquo;You shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;"
8914,2536,1,Exod,35004,"And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;This is the thing which the Lord commanded, saying:"

8931,4136,1,Num,14033,"And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and bear the brunt of your infidelity, until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness."
8932,4137,1,Num,14034,"According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for each day you shall bear your guilt one year, namely forty years, and you shall know My rejection."
8933,4138,1,Num,14035,"I the LORD have spoken this. I will surely do so to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
8934,4139,1,Num,14036,"Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the land,"

8940,4145,1,Num,14042,"Do not go up, lest you be defeated by your enemies, for the LORD is not among you."
8941,4146,1,Num,14043,"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned away from the LORD, the LORD will not be with you.&rdquo;"

8944,5064,1,Deut,5002,The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

8946,5066,1,Deut,5004,The Lord talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire. 
8947,5067,1,Deut,5005,"I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up the mountain. He said: "

8951,5071,1,Deut,5009,"you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, "
8952,5072,1,Deut,5010,"but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. "
8953,5073,1,Deut,5011,"&rsquo;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. "
8954,5074,1,Deut,5012,"&rsquo;Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. "
8955,5075,1,Deut,5013,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work, "
8956,5076,1,Deut,5014,"but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. "
8957,5077,1,Deut,5015,"And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. "
8958,5078,1,Deut,5016,"&rsquo;Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may be well with you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. "
8959,5079,1,Deut,5017,"&rsquo;You shall not murder. "
8960,5080,1,Deut,5018,"&rsquo;You shall not commit adultery. "
8961,5081,1,Deut,5019,"&rsquo;You shall not steal. "
8962,5082,1,Deut,5020,"&rsquo;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. "
8963,5083,1,Deut,5021,"&rsquo;You shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s wife; and you shall not desire your neighbor&rsquo;s house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor&rsquo;s.&rsquo; "
8964,5084,1,Deut,5022,"These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly, in the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. "
8965,5085,1,Deut,5023,"So it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders. "
8966,5086,1,Deut,5024,"And you said: &lsquo;Surely the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man; yet he still lives. "
8967,5087,1,Deut,5025,"Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore, then we shall die. "
8968,5088,1,Deut,5026,"For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? "
8969,5089,1,Deut,5027,"You go near and hear all that the Lord our God may say, and tell us all that the Lord our God says to you, and we will hear and do it.&rsquo; "
8970,5090,1,Deut,5028,"Then the Lord heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me: &lsquo;I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They are right in all that they have spoken. "
8971,5091,1,Deut,5029,"Oh, that they had such a heart in them that they would fear Me and always keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and with their children forever! "
8972,5092,1,Deut,5030,"Go and say to them, &ldquo;Return to your tents.&rdquo; "
8973,5093,1,Deut,5031,"But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe them in the land which I am giving them to possess.&rsquo; "
8974,5094,1,Deut,5032,"Therefore you shall be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. "

8976,5096,1,Deut,6001,"Now this is the commandment, and these are the statutes and judgments which the Lord your God has commanded to teach you, that you may observe them in the land which you are crossing over to possess, "
8977,5097,1,Deut,6002,"that you may fear the Lord your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged. "
8978,5098,1,Deut,6003,"Therefore hear, O Israel, and be careful to observe it, that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly as the Lord God of your fathers has promised you &ndash; &rsquo;a land flowing with milk and honey.&rsquo;"
8979,5099,1,Deut,6004,"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! "
8980,5100,1,Deut,6005,"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. "
8981,5101,1,Deut,6006,And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. 
8982,5102,1,Deut,6007,"You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. "
8983,5103,1,Deut,6008,"You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. "
8984,5104,1,Deut,6009,You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. 
8985,5105,1,Deut,6010,"So it shall be, when the Lord your God brings you into the land of which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you large and beautiful cities which you did not build, "

8987,5107,1,Deut,6012,"then beware, lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. "
8988,5108,1,Deut,6013,"You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him, and shall take oaths in His name. "
8989,5109,1,Deut,6014,"You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are all around you "
8990,5110,1,Deut,6015,"(for the Lord your God is a jealous God among you), lest the anger of the Lord your God be aroused against you and destroy you from the face of the earth. "
8991,5111,1,Deut,6016,You shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted Him in Massah. 
8992,5112,1,Deut,6017,"You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, His testimonies, and His statutes which He has commanded you. "
8993,5113,1,Deut,6018,"And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land of which the Lord swore to your fathers, "
8994,5114,1,Deut,6019,"to cast out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has spoken. "
8995,5115,1,Deut,6020,"When your son asks you in time to come, saying, &lsquo;What is the meaning of the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which the Lord our God has commanded you?&rsquo; "

8997,5117,1,Deut,6022,"and the Lord showed signs and wonders before our eyes, great and severe, against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household. "
8998,5118,1,Deut,6023,"Then He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the land of which He swore to our fathers. "
8999,5119,1,Deut,6024,"And the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is this day. "
9000,5120,1,Deut,6025,"Then it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to observe all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He has commanded us.&rsquo; "
9001,5121,1,Deut,7001,"When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you go to possess, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you, "
9002,5122,1,Deut,7002,"and when the Lord your God delivers them over to you, you shall conquer them and utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them. "

9006,5126,1,Deut,7006,"For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth. "
9007,5127,1,Deut,7007,"The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples; "

9012,5132,1,Deut,7012,"Then it shall come to pass, because you listen to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers. "

9018,5138,1,Deut,7018,"you shall not be afraid of them, but you shall remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: "
9019,5139,1,Deut,7019,"the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out. So shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. "
9020,5140,1,Deut,7020,"Moreover the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left, who hide themselves from you, are destroyed. "
9021,5141,1,Deut,7021,"You shall not be terrified of them; for the Lord your God, the great and awesome God, is among you. "
9022,5142,1,Deut,7022,"And the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you little by little; you will be unable to destroy them at once, lest the beasts of the field become too numerous for you. "
9023,5143,1,Deut,7023,"But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, and will inflict defeat upon them until they are destroyed. "
9024,5144,1,Deut,7024,"And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will destroy their name from under heaven; no one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them. "
9025,7302,1,1Kg,5004,"And when they arose early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands were broken off on the threshold; only Dagon&rsquo;s torso was left of it. "
9026,7303,1,1Kg,5005,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon&rsquo;s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day. "
9027,7304,1,1Kg,5006,"But the hand of the Lord was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He ravaged them and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory. "
9028,7305,1,1Kg,5007,"And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, &ldquo;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god.&rdquo; "
9029,7306,1,1Kg,5008,"Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the lords of the Philistines, and said, &ldquo;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&rdquo; And they answered, &ldquo;Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to Gath.&rdquo; So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away. "
9030,7307,1,1Kg,5009,"So it was, after they had carried it away, that the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction; and He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out on them. "
9031,7308,1,1Kg,5010,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, &ldquo;They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!&rdquo; "
9032,7309,1,1Kg,5011,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, &ldquo;Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.&rdquo; For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. "
9033,1994,1,Exod,17010,"So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
9034,1995,1,Exod,17011,"And so it was, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
9035,1996,1,Exod,17012,"But Moses&rsquo; hands became heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
9036,1997,1,Exod,17013,So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
9037,1998,1,Exod,17014,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.&rdquo;"
9038,1999,1,Exod,17015,"And Moses built an altar and called its name, The-Lord-Is-My-Banner;"
9039,2000,1,Exod,17016,"for he said, &ldquo;Because the Lord has sworn: the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.&rdquo;"
9040,2001,1,Exod,18001,"And Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people &ndash; that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt."
9041,2002,1,Exod,18002,"Then Jethro, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses&rsquo; wife, after he had sent her back,"
9042,2003,1,Exod,18003,"with her two sons, of whom the name of one was Gershom (for he said, &ldquo;I have been a stranger in a foreign land&rdquo;)"
9043,2004,1,Exod,18004,"and the name of the other was Eliezer (for he said, &ldquo;The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh&rdquo;);"
9044,2005,1,Exod,18005,"and Jethro, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mountain of God."
9045,2006,1,Exod,18006,"Now he had said to Moses, &ldquo;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.&rdquo;"
9046,2007,1,Exod,18007,"So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. And they asked each other about their well-being, and they went into the tent."
9047,2008,1,Exod,18008,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&rsquo;s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and how the Lord had delivered them."
9048,2009,1,Exod,18009,"Then Jethro rejoiced for all the good which the Lord had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
9049,2010,1,Exod,18010,"And Jethro said, &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
9050,2011,1,Exod,18011,"&ldquo;Now I know that the Lord is greater than all the gods; for in the very thing in which they behaved proudly, He was above them.&rdquo;"
9051,2012,1,Exod,18012,"Then Jethro, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, took a burnt offering and other sacrifices to offer to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses&rsquo; father-in-law before God."
9052,2013,1,Exod,18013,"And so it was, on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening."
9053,2014,1,Exod,18014,"So when Moses&rsquo; father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, &ldquo;What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?&rdquo;"
9054,2015,1,Exod,18015,"And Moses said to his father-in-law, &ldquo;Because the people come to me to inquire of God."
9055,2016,1,Exod,18016,"&ldquo;When they have a difficulty, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.&rdquo;"
9056,2017,1,Exod,18017,"So Moses&rsquo; father-in-law said to him, &ldquo;The thing that you do is not good."
9057,2018,1,Exod,18018,"&ldquo;Both you and these people who are with you will surely wear yourselves out. For this thing is too much for you; you are not able to perform it by yourself."
9058,2019,1,Exod,18019,"&ldquo;Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you: Stand before God for the people, so that you may bring the difficulties to God."
9059,2020,1,Exod,18020,"&ldquo;And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and show them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do."
9060,2021,1,Exod,18021,"&ldquo;Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
9061,2022,1,Exod,18022,"&ldquo;And let them judge the people at all times. Then it will be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you, for they will bear the burden with you."
9062,2023,1,Exod,18023,"&ldquo;If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will also go to their place in peace.&rdquo;"
9063,2024,1,Exod,18024,So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
9064,2025,1,Exod,18025,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
9065,2026,1,Exod,18026,"So they judged the people at all times; the hard cases they brought to Moses, but they judged every small case themselves."
9066,2027,1,Exod,18027,"Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own land."
9067,2028,1,Exod,19001,"In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai."
9068,2029,1,Exod,19002,"For they had departed from Rephidim, had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before the mountain."
9069,2030,1,Exod,19003,"And Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:"
9070,2031,1,Exod,19004,"&lsquo;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought you to Myself."
9071,2032,1,Exod,19005,"&lsquo;Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine."
9072,2033,1,Exod,19006,"&lsquo;And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&rsquo; These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&rdquo;"
9073,2034,1,Exod,19007,"So Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the Lord commanded him."
9074,2035,1,Exod,19008,"Then all the people answered together and said, &ldquo;All that the Lord has spoken we will do.&rdquo; So Moses brought back the words of the people to the Lord."
9075,2036,1,Exod,19009,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, I come to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.&rdquo; So Moses told the words of the people to the Lord."
9076,2037,1,Exod,19010,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes."
9077,2038,1,Exod,19011,"&ldquo;And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."
9078,2039,1,Exod,19012,"&ldquo;You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, &lsquo;Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death."
9079,2040,1,Exod,19013,"&lsquo;Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with an arrow; whether man or beast, he shall not live.&rsquo; When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come near the mountain.&rdquo;"
9080,2041,1,Exod,19014,"So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes."
9081,2042,1,Exod,19015,"And he said to the people, &ldquo;Be ready for the third day; do not come near your wives.&rdquo;"
9082,2043,1,Exod,19016,"Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunderings and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled."
9083,2044,1,Exod,19017,"And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain."
9084,2045,1,Exod,19018,"Now Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly."
9085,2046,1,Exod,19019,"And when the blast of the trumpet sounded long and became louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by voice."
9086,2047,1,Exod,19020,"Then the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up."
9087,2048,1,Exod,19021,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to gaze at the Lord, and many of them perish."
9088,2049,1,Exod,19022,"&ldquo;Also let the priests who come near the Lord consecrate themselves, lest the Lord break out against them.&rdquo;"
9089,2050,1,Exod,19023,"But Moses said to the Lord, &ldquo;The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You warned us, saying, &lsquo;Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9090,2051,1,Exod,19024,"Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Away! Get down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, lest He break out against them.&rdquo;"
9091,2052,1,Exod,19025,So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
9092,2053,1,Exod,20001,"And God spoke all these words, saying:"
9093,2054,1,Exod,20002,"&ldquo;I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
9094,2055,1,Exod,20003,"&ldquo;You shall have no other gods before Me."
9095,2056,1,Exod,20004,"&ldquo;You shall not make for yourself a carved image &ndash; any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;"
9096,2057,1,Exod,20005,"you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
9097,2058,1,Exod,20006,"but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments."
9098,2059,1,Exod,20007,"&ldquo;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain."
9099,2060,1,Exod,20008,"&ldquo;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."
9100,2061,1,Exod,20009,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
9101,2062,1,Exod,20010,"but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates."
9102,2063,1,Exod,20011,"For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."
9103,2064,1,Exod,20012,"&ldquo;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you."
9104,2065,1,Exod,20013,"&ldquo;You shall not murder."
9105,2066,1,Exod,20014,"&ldquo;You shall not commit adultery."
9106,2067,1,Exod,20015,"&ldquo;You shall not steal."
9107,2068,1,Exod,20016,"&ldquo;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."
9108,2069,1,Exod,20017,"&ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;"
9109,2070,1,Exod,20018,"Now all the people witnessed the thunderings, the lightning flashes, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood afar off."
9110,2071,1,Exod,20019,"Then they said to Moses, &ldquo;You speak with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.&rdquo;"
9111,2072,1,Exod,20020,"And Moses said to the people, &ldquo;Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before you, so that you may not sin.&rdquo;"
9112,2073,1,Exod,20021,"So the people stood afar off, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was."
9113,2074,1,Exod,20022,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: &lsquo;You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
9114,2075,1,Exod,20023,"&lsquo;You shall not make anything to be with Me &ndash; gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves."
9115,2076,1,Exod,20024,"&lsquo;An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name I will come to you, and I will bless you."
9116,2077,1,Exod,20025,"&lsquo;And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone; for if you use your tool on it, you have profaned it."
9117,2078,1,Exod,20026,"&lsquo;Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.&rsquo;"
9118,2079,1,Exod,21001,"&ldquo;Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them:"
9119,7766,1,1Kg,21015,"Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?&rdquo; "
9120,7767,1,1Kg,22001,"David therefore departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father&rsquo;s house heard it, they went down there to him. "
9121,7768,1,1Kg,22002,"And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about four hundred men with him. "
9122,7769,1,1Kg,22003,"Then David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, &ldquo;Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what God will do for me.&rdquo; "
9123,7770,1,1Kg,22004,"So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. "
9124,7771,1,1Kg,22005,"Now the prophet Gad said to David, &ldquo;Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.&rdquo; So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth. "
9125,7772,1,1Kg,22006,"When Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered &ndash; now Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him &ndash; "
9126,7773,1,1Kg,22007,"then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, &ldquo;Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds? "
9127,7774,1,1Kg,22008,"All of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who reveals to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse; and there is not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day.&rdquo; "
9128,7775,1,1Kg,22009,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, &ldquo;I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. "

9133,7780,1,1Kg,22014,"So Ahimelech answered the king and said, &ldquo;And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is the king&rsquo;s son-in-law, who goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house? "
9134,7781,1,1Kg,22015,"Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, or to any in the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, little or much.&rdquo; "
9135,7782,1,1Kg,22016,"And the king said, &ldquo;You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; "

9137,7784,1,1Kg,22018,"And the king said to Doeg, &ldquo;You turn and kill the priests!&rdquo; So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests, and killed on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen ephod. "
9138,7785,1,1Kg,22019,"Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep &ndash; with the edge of the sword. "
9139,7786,1,1Kg,22020,"Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. "

9152,7799,1,1Kg,23010,"Then David said, &ldquo;O Lord God of Israel, Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake. "
9153,7800,1,1Kg,23011,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;He will come down.&rdquo; "
9154,7801,1,1Kg,23012,"Then David said, &ldquo;Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;They will deliver you.&rdquo; "
9155,7802,1,1Kg,23013,"So David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go. Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; so he halted the expedition. "
9156,7803,1,1Kg,23014,"And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in the mountains in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand. "
9157,7804,1,1Kg,23015,So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in a forest.
9158,7805,1,1Kg,23016,"Then Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God. "
9159,7806,1,1Kg,23017,"And he said to him, &ldquo;Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Even my father Saul knows that.&rdquo; "

9163,7810,1,1Kg,23021,"And Saul said, &ldquo;Blessed are you of the Lord, for you have compassion on me. "
9164,7811,1,1Kg,23022,"Please go and find out for sure, and see the place where his hideout is, and who has seen him there. For I am told he is very crafty. "
9165,7812,1,1Kg,23023,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search for him throughout all the clans of Judah.&rdquo; "
9166,7813,1,1Kg,23024,"So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. "
9167,7814,1,1Kg,23025,"When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David. Therefore he went down to the rock, and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon. "
9168,7815,1,1Kg,23026,"Then Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. So David made haste to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were encircling David and his men to take them. "
9169,7816,1,1Kg,23027,"But a messenger came to Saul, saying, &ldquo;Hasten and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!&rdquo; "

9171,7818,1,1Kg,23029,Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at En Gedi. 
9172,7819,1,1Kg,24001,"Now it happened, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, &ldquo;Take note! David is in the Wilderness of En Gedi.&rdquo; "
9173,7820,1,1Kg,24002,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats. "
9174,7821,1,1Kg,24003,"So he came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to attend to his needs. (David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.) "
9175,7822,1,1Kg,24004,"Then the men of David said to him, &ldquo;This is the day of which the Lord said to you, &lsquo;Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it seems good to you.&rsquo; &ldquo; And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul&rsquo;s robe. "
9176,7823,1,1Kg,24005,"Now it happened afterward that David&rsquo;s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul&rsquo;s robe. "
9177,7824,1,1Kg,24006,"And he said to his men, &ldquo;The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.&rdquo; "
9178,7825,1,1Kg,24007,"So David restrained his servants with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave and went on his way. "
9179,7826,1,1Kg,24008,"David also arose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, saying, &ldquo;My lord the king!&rdquo; And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed down. "
9180,7827,1,1Kg,24009,"And David said to Saul: &ldquo;Why do you listen to the words of men who say, &lsquo;Indeed David seeks your harm&rsquo;? "
9181,7828,1,1Kg,24010,"Look, this day your eyes have seen that the Lord delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and someone urged me to kill you. But my eye spared you, and I said, &lsquo;I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.&rsquo; "
9182,7829,1,1Kg,24011,"Moreover, my father, see! Yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor rebellion in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. Yet you hunt my life to take it. "
9183,7830,1,1Kg,24012,"Let the Lord judge between you and me, and let the Lord avenge me on you. But my hand shall not be against you. "
9184,7831,1,1Kg,24013,"As the proverb of the ancients says, &lsquo;Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.&rsquo; But my hand shall not be against you. "

9186,7833,1,1Kg,24015,"Therefore let the Lord be judge, and judge between you and me, and see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.&rdquo; "
9187,7834,1,1Kg,24016,"So it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, &ldquo;Is this your voice, my son David?&rdquo; And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. "
9188,7835,1,1Kg,24017,"Then he said to David: &ldquo;You are more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil. "

9308,15344,1,Isa,34013,"And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and brambles in its fortresses; it shall be a habitation of jackals, a courtyard for ostriches."
9309,15345,1,Isa,34014,"The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the jackals, and the wild goat shall bleat to its companion; also the night creature shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest."
9310,15346,1,Isa,34015,"There the arrow snake shall make her nest and lay eggs and hatch, and gather them under her shadow; there also shall the hawks be gathered, every one with her mate."
9311,15347,1,Isa,34016,"&ldquo;Search from the book of the Lord, and read: not one of these shall fail; not one shall lack her mate. For My mouth has commanded it, and His Spirit has gathered them."

9313,15349,1,Isa,35001,"The wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose; "
9314,15350,1,Isa,35002,"It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice, even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellence of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the Lord, the excellency of our God."

9318,15354,1,Isa,35006,"Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb sing. For waters shall burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert."
9319,15355,1,Isa,35007,"The parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, where each lay, there shall be grass with reeds and rushes."
9320,15356,1,Isa,35008,"A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for others. Whoever walks the road, although a fool, shall not go astray."
9321,15357,1,Isa,35009,"No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up on it; it shall not be found there. But the redeemed shall walk there,"
9322,15358,1,Isa,35010,"and the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."
9323,15359,1,Isa,36001,Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
9324,15360,1,Isa,36002,"Then the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeha with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller&rsquo;s Field."
9325,15361,1,Isa,36003,"And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him."
9326,15362,1,Isa,36004,"Then the Rabshakeh said to them, &ldquo;Say now to Hezekiah, &lsquo;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: &ldquo;What confidence is this in which you trust?"
9327,15363,1,Isa,36005,"&ldquo;I say you speak of having plans and power for war; but they are mere words. Now in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?"
9328,15364,1,Isa,36006,"&ldquo;Look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him."
9329,15365,1,Isa,36007,"&ldquo;But if you say to me, &lsquo;We trust in the Lord our God,&rsquo; is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, &lsquo;You shall worship before this altar&rsquo;?&rdquo;&rsquo;"
9330,15366,1,Isa,36008,"&ldquo;Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses &ndash; if you are able on your part to put riders on them!"
9331,15367,1,Isa,36009,"&ldquo;How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master&rsquo;s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?"
9332,15368,1,Isa,36010,"&ldquo;Have I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? The Lord said to me, &lsquo;Go up against this land, and destroy it.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9333,15369,1,Isa,36011,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, &ldquo;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in Hebrewa in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.&rdquo;"
9334,15370,1,Isa,36012,"But the Rabshakeh said, &ldquo;Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?&rdquo;"
9335,15371,1,Isa,36013,"Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and said, &ldquo;Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
9336,15372,1,Isa,36014,"&ldquo;Thus says the king: &lsquo;Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you;"

9338,15374,1,Isa,36016,"&ldquo;Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: &lsquo;Make peace with me by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;"
9339,15375,1,Isa,36017,"&lsquo;until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
9340,15376,1,Isa,36018,"&lsquo;Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver us.&rdquo; Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria?"
9341,15377,1,Isa,36019,"&lsquo;Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand?"
9342,15378,1,Isa,36020,"&lsquo;Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9343,15379,1,Isa,36021,"But they held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king&rsquo;s commandment was, &ldquo;Do not answer him.&rdquo;"
9344,15380,1,Isa,36022,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh."
9345,15381,1,Isa,37001,"And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord."
9346,15382,1,Isa,37002,"Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz."
9347,15383,1,Isa,37003,"And they said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Hezekiah: &lsquo;This day is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth."
9348,15384,1,Isa,37004,"&lsquo;It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant tha"
9349,15385,1,Isa,37005,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
9350,15386,1,Isa,37006,"And Isaiah said to them, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to your master, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord: &ldquo;Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me."
9351,15387,1,Isa,37007,"&ldquo;Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.&rdquo;"
9352,15388,1,Isa,37008,"Then the Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish."
9353,15389,1,Isa,37009,"And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, &ldquo;He has come out to make war with you.&rdquo; so when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,"
9354,15390,1,Isa,37010,"&ldquo;Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: &lsquo;Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, &ldquo;Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&rdquo;"

9356,15392,1,Isa,37012,"&lsquo;Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?"

9358,15394,1,Isa,37014,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord."
9359,15395,1,Isa,37015,"Then Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying:"
9360,15396,1,Isa,37016,"&ldquo;O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
9361,16874,1,Ezek,34013,"&ldquo;And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country."
9362,16875,1,Ezek,34014,"&ldquo;I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel."

9364,16877,1,Ezek,34016,"&ldquo;I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them in judgment.&rdquo;"
9365,16878,1,Ezek,34017,"&lsquo;And as for you, O My flock, thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats."
9366,16879,1,Ezek,34018,"&ldquo;Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture &ndash; and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the residue with your feet?"
9367,16880,1,Ezek,34019,"&ldquo;And as for My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.&rdquo;"
9368,16881,1,Ezek,34020,"&lsquo;Therefore thus says the Lord God to them: &ldquo;Behold, I Myself will judge between the fat and the lean sheep."
9369,16882,1,Ezek,34021,"&ldquo;Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, butted all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad,"
9370,16883,1,Ezek,34022,"&ldquo;therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep."
9371,16884,1,Ezek,34023,"&ldquo;I will establish one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them &ndash; My servant David. He shall feed them and be their shepherd."

9432,16945,1,Ezek,36038,"&ldquo;Like a flock offered as holy sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem on its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9433,16946,1,Ezek,37001,"The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones."
9434,16947,1,Ezek,37002,"Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry."
9435,16948,1,Ezek,37003,"And He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, can these bones live?&rdquo; So I answered, &ldquo;O Lord God, You know.&rdquo;"
9436,16949,1,Ezek,37004,"Again He said to me, &ldquo;Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, &lsquo;O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!"
9437,16950,1,Ezek,37005,"Thus says the Lord God to these bones: &ldquo;Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live."
9438,16951,1,Ezek,37006,"I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9439,16952,1,Ezek,37007,"So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone."
9440,16953,1,Ezek,37008,"Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them."
9441,16954,1,Ezek,37009,"Also He said to me, &ldquo;Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9442,16955,1,Ezek,37010,"So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army."
9443,16956,1,Ezek,37011,"Then He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They indeed say, &lsquo;Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!&rsquo;"
9444,16957,1,Ezek,37012,"Therefore prophesy and say to them, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel."
9445,16958,1,Ezek,37013,"Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves."
9446,16959,1,Ezek,37014,"I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it and performed it,&rdquo; says the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9447,738,1,Gen,27010,"&ldquo;Then you shall take it to your father, that he may eat it, and that he may bless you before his death.&rdquo;"
9448,739,1,Gen,27011,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &ldquo;Look, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth-skinned man."
9449,740,1,Gen,27012,"&ldquo;Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.&rdquo;"
9450,741,1,Gen,27013,"But his mother said to him, &ldquo;Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.&rdquo;"
9451,742,1,Gen,27014,"And he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved."
9452,743,1,Gen,27015,"Then Rebekah took the choice clothes of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son."
9453,744,1,Gen,27016,And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
9454,745,1,Gen,27017,"Then she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
9455,746,1,Gen,27018,"So he went to his father and said, &ldquo;My father.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am. Who are you, my son?&rdquo;"
9456,747,1,Gen,27019,"Jacob said to his father, &ldquo;I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.&rdquo;"
9457,748,1,Gen,27020,"But Isaac said to his son, &ldquo;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Because the Lord your God brought it to me.&rdquo;"
9458,749,1,Gen,27021,"Then Isaac said to Jacob, &ldquo;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.&rdquo;"
9459,750,1,Gen,27022,"So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, &ldquo;The voice is Jacob&rsquo;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&rdquo;"
9460,751,1,Gen,27023,"And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&rsquo;s hands; so he blessed him."
9461,752,1,Gen,27024,"Then he said, &ldquo;Are you really my son Esau?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;"
9462,753,1,Gen,27025,"He said, &ldquo;Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son&rsquo;s game, so that my soul may bless you.&rdquo; So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank."
9463,754,1,Gen,27026,"Then his father Isaac said to him, &ldquo;Come near now and kiss me, my son.&rdquo;"
9464,755,1,Gen,27027,"And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said: &ldquo;Surely, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed."
9465,756,1,Gen,27028,"Therefore may God give you of the dew of heaven, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine."
9466,757,1,Gen,27029,"Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brethren, and let your mother&rsquo;s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be those who bless you!&rdquo; "
9467,758,1,Gen,27030,"Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
9468,759,1,Gen,27031,"He also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, &ldquo;Let my father arise and eat of his son&rsquo;s game, that your soul may bless me.&rdquo;"
9469,760,1,Gen,27032,"And his father Isaac said to him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&rdquo;"
9470,761,1,Gen,27033,"Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, &ldquo;Who? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him &ndash; and indeed he shall be blessed.&rdquo;"
9471,762,1,Gen,27034,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, &ldquo;Bless me &ndash; me also, O my father!&rdquo;"
9472,763,1,Gen,27035,"But he said, &ldquo;Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.&rdquo;"
9473,764,1,Gen,27036,"And Esau said, &ldquo;Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now look, he has taken away my blessing!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Have you not reserved a blessing for me?&rdquo;"
9474,765,1,Gen,27037,"Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, &ldquo;Indeed I have made him your master, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?&rdquo;"
9475,766,1,Gen,27038,"And Esau said to his father, &ldquo;Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me &ndash; me also, O my father!&rdquo; And Esau lifted up his voice and wept."
9476,767,1,Gen,27039,"Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: &ldquo;Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above."
9477,768,1,Gen,27040,"By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass, when you become restless, that you shall break his yoke from your neck.&rdquo;"
9478,769,1,Gen,27041,"So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, &ldquo;The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&rdquo;"
9479,770,1,Gen,27042,"And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, &ldquo;Surely your brother Esau comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you."
9480,771,1,Gen,27043,"&ldquo;Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban in Haran."
9481,772,1,Gen,27044,"&ldquo;And stay with him a few days, until your brother&rsquo;s fury turns away,"
9482,773,1,Gen,27045,"&ldquo;until your brother&rsquo;s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?&rdquo;"
9483,774,1,Gen,27046,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, &ldquo;I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these who are the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?&rdquo;"
9484,775,1,Gen,28001,"Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him: &ldquo;You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan."
9485,776,1,Gen,28002,"&ldquo;Arise, go to Padan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother&rsquo;s father; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother&rsquo;s brother."
9486,777,1,Gen,28003,"&ldquo;May God Almighty bless you, And make you fruitful and multiply you, That you may be an assembly of peoples;"
9487,778,1,Gen,28004,"And give you the blessing of Abraham, To you and your descendants with you, That you may inherit the land In which you are a stranger, Which God gave to Abraham.&rdquo;"
9488,779,1,Gen,28005,"So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau."
9489,780,1,Gen,28006,"Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, &ldquo;You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,&rdquo;"
9490,781,1,Gen,28007,and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan Aram.
9491,782,1,Gen,28008,Also Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please his father Isaac.
9492,783,1,Gen,28009,"So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had."
9493,784,1,Gen,28010,Now Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
9494,785,1,Gen,28011,"So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep."
9495,786,1,Gen,28012,"Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it."
9496,787,1,Gen,28013,"And behold, the Lord stood above it and said: &ldquo;I am the Lord God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and your descendants."
9497,788,1,Gen,28014,"&ldquo;Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
9498,789,1,Gen,28015,"&ldquo;Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.&rdquo;"
9499,790,1,Gen,28016,"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, &ldquo;Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.&rdquo;"
9500,791,1,Gen,28017,"And he was afraid and said, &ldquo;How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!&rdquo;"
9501,792,1,Gen,28018,"Then Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it."
9502,793,1,Gen,28019,"And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city had been Luz previously."
9503,794,1,Gen,28020,"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, &ldquo;If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,"
9504,795,1,Gen,28021,"&ldquo;so that I come back to my father&rsquo;s house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God."
9505,796,1,Gen,28022,"&ldquo;And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God&rsquo;s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.&rdquo;"
9506,797,1,Gen,29001,So Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the East.
9507,798,1,Gen,29002,"And he looked, and saw a well in the field; and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. A large stone was on the well&rsquo;s mouth."
9508,799,1,Gen,29003,"Now all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well&rsquo;s mouth."
9509,800,1,Gen,29004,"And Jacob said to them, &ldquo;My brethren, where are you from?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;We are from Haran.&rdquo;"
9510,801,1,Gen,29005,"Then he said to them, &ldquo;Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;We know him.&rdquo;"
9511,802,1,Gen,29006,"So he said to them, &ldquo;Is he well?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;He is well. And look, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.&rdquo;"
9512,803,1,Gen,29007,"Then he said, &ldquo;Look, it is still high day; it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.&rdquo;"
9513,804,1,Gen,29008,"But they said, &ldquo;We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth; then we water the sheep.&rdquo;"
9514,805,1,Gen,29009,"Now while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess."
9515,806,1,Gen,29010,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother."
9516,807,1,Gen,29011,"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept."
9517,808,1,Gen,29012,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&rsquo;s relative and that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son. So she ran and told her father."
9518,809,1,Gen,29013,"Then it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister&rsquo;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things."
9519,810,1,Gen,29014,"And Laban said to him, &ldquo;Surely you are my bone and my flesh.&rdquo; And he stayed with him for a month."
9520,811,1,Gen,29015,"Then Laban said to Jacob, &ldquo;Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?&rdquo;"
9521,812,1,Gen,29016,"Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
9522,813,1,Gen,29017,"Leah&rsquo;s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful of form and appearance."
9523,814,1,Gen,29018,"Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, &ldquo;I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.&rdquo;"
9524,815,1,Gen,29019,"And Laban said, &ldquo;It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.&rdquo;"
9525,816,1,Gen,29020,"So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed only a few days to him because of the love he had for her."
9526,817,1,Gen,29021,"Then Jacob said to Laban, &ldquo;Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.&rdquo;"
9527,818,1,Gen,29022,And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.
9528,819,1,Gen,29023,"Now it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her."
9529,820,1,Gen,29024,And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid.
9530,821,1,Gen,29025,"So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, &ldquo;What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?&rdquo;"
9531,822,1,Gen,29026,"And Laban said, &ldquo;It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
9532,1470,1,Gen,48018,"And Joseph said to his father, &ldquo;Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.&rdquo;"
9533,1471,1,Gen,48019,"But his father refused and said, &ldquo;I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.&rdquo;"
9534,1472,1,Gen,48020,"So he blessed them that day, saying, &ldquo;By you Israel will bless, saying, &lsquo;May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh!&rsquo;&rdquo; And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
9535,1473,1,Gen,48021,"Then Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers."

9570,1508,1,Gen,50001,"Then Joseph fell on his father&rsquo;s face, and wept over him, and kissed him."
9571,1509,1,Gen,50002,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
9572,1510,1,Gen,50003,"Forty days were required for him, for such are the days required for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days."
9573,1511,1,Gen,50004,"Now when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying,"
9574,1512,1,Gen,50005,"&lsquo;My father made me swear, saying, &ldquo;Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.&rdquo; Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come back.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9575,1513,1,Gen,50006,"And Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.&rdquo;"
9576,1514,1,Gen,50007,"So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
9577,1515,1,Gen,50008,"as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father&rsquo;s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen."
9578,1516,1,Gen,50009,"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great gathering."
9579,1517,1,Gen,50010,"Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and they mourned there with a great and very solemn lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father."
9580,1518,1,Gen,50011,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, &ldquo;This is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.&rdquo; Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
9581,1519,1,Gen,50012,So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them.
9582,1520,1,Gen,50013,"For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place."
9583,1521,1,Gen,50014,"And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father."
9584,1522,1,Gen,50015,"When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &ldquo;Perhaps Joseph will hate us, and may actually repay us for all the evil which we did to him.&rdquo;"
9585,1523,1,Gen,50016,"So they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Before your father died he commanded, saying,"
9586,1524,1,Gen,50017,"&lsquo;Thus you shall say to Joseph: &ldquo;I beg you, please forgive the trespass of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you.&rdquo;&rsquo; Now, please, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father.&rdquo; And Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
9587,1525,1,Gen,50018,"Then his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, &ldquo;Behold, we are your servants.&rdquo;"
9588,1526,1,Gen,50019,"Joseph said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?"
9589,1527,1,Gen,50020,"&ldquo;But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive."
9590,1528,1,Gen,50021,"&ldquo;Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.&rdquo; And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them."
9591,1529,1,Gen,50022,"So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father&rsquo;s household. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years."
9592,1530,1,Gen,50023,"Joseph saw Ephraim&rsquo;s children to the third generation. The children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were also brought up on Joseph&rsquo;s knees."
9593,1531,1,Gen,50024,"And Joseph said to his brethren, &ldquo;I am dying; but God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&rdquo;"
9594,1532,1,Gen,50025,"Then Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.&rdquo;"
9595,1533,1,Gen,50026,"So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
9596,1534,1,Exod,1001,"Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt; each man and his household came with Jacob:"
9597,1535,1,Exod,1002,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;"
9598,1536,1,Exod,1003,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;"
9599,1537,1,Exod,1004,"Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
9600,1538,1,Exod,1005,All those who were descendants of Jacob were seventy persons (for Joseph was in Egypt already).
9601,1539,1,Exod,1006,"And Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation."
9602,1540,1,Exod,1007,"But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them."
9603,1541,1,Exod,1008,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph."
9604,1542,1,Exod,1009,"And he said to his people, &ldquo;Look, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we;"
9605,1543,1,Exod,1010,"&ldquo;come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and it happen, in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and so go up out of the land.&rdquo;"
9606,1544,1,Exod,1011,"Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses."
9607,1545,1,Exod,1012,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel."
9608,1546,1,Exod,1013,So the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigor.
9609,1547,1,Exod,1014,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage &ndash; in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their service in which they made them serve was with rigor."
9610,1548,1,Exod,1015,"Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah;"
9611,1549,1,Exod,1016,"and he said, &ldquo;When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstools, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.&rdquo;"
9612,1550,1,Exod,1017,"But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive."
9613,1551,1,Exod,1018,"So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, &ldquo;Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?&rdquo;"
9614,1552,1,Exod,1019,"And the midwives said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are lively and give birth before the midwives come to them.&rdquo;"
9615,1553,1,Exod,1020,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty."
9616,3346,1,Lev,20027,"&lsquo;A man or a woman who is a medium, or who has familiar spirits, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones. Their blood shall be upon them.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9617,3347,1,Lev,21001,"And the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: &lsquo;None shall defile himself for the dead among his people,"
9618,3348,1,Lev,21002,"except for his relatives who are nearest to him: his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, and his brother;"
9619,3349,1,Lev,21003,"also his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband, for her he may defile himself."
9620,3350,1,Lev,21004,"Otherwise he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself."
9621,3351,1,Lev,21005,"&lsquo;They shall not make any bald place on their heads, nor shall they shave the edges of their beards nor make any cuttings in their flesh."
9622,3352,1,Lev,21006,"They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy."
9623,3353,1,Lev,21007,"They shall not take a wife who is a harlot or a defiled woman, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for the priest is holy to his God."
9624,3354,1,Lev,21008,"Therefore you shall consecrate him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy."
9625,3355,1,Lev,21009,"The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire."
9626,3356,1,Lev,21010,"&lsquo;He who is the high priest among his brethren, on whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes;"
9627,3357,1,Lev,21011,"nor shall he go near any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or his mother;"
9628,3358,1,Lev,21012,"nor shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD."
9629,3359,1,Lev,21013,And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
9630,3360,1,Lev,21014,"A widow or a divorced woman or a defiled woman or a harlot &ndash; these he shall not marry; but he shall take a virgin of his own people as wife."
9631,3361,1,Lev,21015,"Nor shall he profane his posterity among his people, for I the LORD sanctify him.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9632,3362,1,Lev,21016,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
9633,3363,1,Lev,21017,"&ldquo;Speak to Aaron, saying: &lsquo;No man of your descendants in succeeding generations, who has any defect, may approach to offer the bread of his God."
9634,3364,1,Lev,21018,"For any man who has a defect shall not approach: a man blind or lame, who has a marred face or any limb too long,"
9635,3365,1,Lev,21019,"a man who has a broken foot or broken hand,"
9636,3366,1,Lev,21020,"or is a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man who has a defect in his eye, or eczema or scab, or is a eunuch."
9637,3367,1,Lev,21021,"No man of the descendants of Aaron the priest, who has a defect, shall come near to offer the offerings made by fire to the LORD. He has a defect; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God."
9638,3368,1,Lev,21022,"He may eat the bread of his God, both the most holy and the holy;"

9641,3371,1,Lev,22001,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
9642,3372,1,Lev,22002,"&ldquo;Speak to Aaron and his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they do not profane My holy name by what they dedicate to Me: I am the LORD."

9714,2959,1,Lev,9005,So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
9715,2960,1,Lev,9006,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;This is the thing which the LORD commanded you to do, and the glory of the LORD will appear to you.&rdquo;"
9716,2961,1,Lev,9007,"And Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the LORD commanded.&rdquo;"
9717,2962,1,Lev,9008,"Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself."
9718,2963,1,Lev,9009,"Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar."
9719,2964,1,Lev,9010,"But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses."
9720,2965,1,Lev,9011,The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
9721,2966,1,Lev,9012,"And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar."
9722,2967,1,Lev,9013,"Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar."
9723,2968,1,Lev,9014,"And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar."
9724,2969,1,Lev,9015,"Then he brought the people&rsquo;s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one."
9725,2970,1,Lev,9016,And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the prescribed manner.
9726,2971,1,Lev,9017,"Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning."
9727,2972,1,Lev,9018,"He also killed the bull and the ram as sacrifices of peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aaron&rsquo;s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar,"
9728,2973,1,Lev,9019,"and the fat from the bull and the ram &ndash; the fatty tail, what covers the entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver;"
9729,2974,1,Lev,9020,"and they put the fat on the breasts. Then he burned the fat on the altar;"
9730,2975,1,Lev,9021,"but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded."
9731,2976,1,Lev,9022,"Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings."
9732,2977,1,Lev,9023,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people,"
9733,2978,1,Lev,9024,"and fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
9734,2979,1,Lev,10001,"Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it, put incense on it, and offered profane fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them."
9735,2980,1,Lev,10002,"So fire went out from the LORD and devoured them, and they died before the LORD."
9736,2981,1,Lev,10003,"And Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;This is what the LORD spoke, saying: &lsquo;By those who come near Me, I must be regarded as holy; And before all the people, I must be glorified.&rsquo;&rdquo; So Aaron held his peace."
9737,2982,1,Lev,10004,"Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, &ldquo;Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.&rdquo;"
9738,2983,1,Lev,10005,"So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said."
9739,2984,1,Lev,10006,"And Moses said to Aaron, and to Elemazar and Ithamar, his sons, &ldquo;Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD has kindled."
9740,2985,1,Lev,10007,"You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.&rdquo; And they did according to the word of Moses."
9741,2986,1,Lev,10008,"Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying:"
9742,2987,1,Lev,10009,"&ldquo;Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations,"
9743,2988,1,Lev,10010,"that you may distinguish between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean,"
9744,2989,1,Lev,10011,"and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.&rdquo;"
9745,2990,1,Lev,10012,"And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Elemazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: &ldquo;Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings made by fire to the LORD, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy."
9746,2991,1,Lev,10013,"You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons&rsquo; due, of the sacrifices made by fire to the LORD; for so I have been commanded."
9747,2992,1,Lev,10014,"The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for they are your due and your sons&rsquo; due, which are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel."
9748,2993,1,Lev,10015,"The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to offer as a wave offering before the LORD. And it shall be yours and your sons&rsquo; with you, by a statute forever, as the LORD has commanded.&rdquo;"
9749,2994,1,Lev,10016,"Then Moses made careful inquiry about the goat of the sin offering, and there it was &ndash; burned up. And he was angry with Elemazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,"
9750,2995,1,Lev,10017,"&ldquo;Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?"
9751,2996,1,Lev,10018,"See! Its blood was not brought inside the holy place; indeed you should have eaten it in a holy place, as I commanded.&rdquo;"
9752,2997,1,Lev,10019,"And Aaron said to Moses, &ldquo;Look, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and such things have befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?&rdquo;"
9753,2998,1,Lev,10020,"So when Moses heard that, he was content."
9754,2999,1,Lev,11001,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
9755,3000,1,Lev,11002,"Say to the Israelites: &lsquo;Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat:"
9756,3001,1,Lev,11003,You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.
9757,3002,1,Lev,11004," &lsquo;There are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you."
9758,3003,1,Lev,11005,"The coney, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you."
9759,3004,1,Lev,11006,"The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you."

9764,3009,1,Lev,11011,"And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses."
9765,3010,1,Lev,11012,Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you.
9766,3011,1,Lev,11013," &lsquo;These are the birds you are to detest and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,"

9773,3018,1,Lev,11020," &lsquo;All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you."
9774,3019,1,Lev,11021,"There are, however, some winged creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground."
9775,3020,1,Lev,11022,"Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper."
9776,3021,1,Lev,11023,But all other winged creatures that have four legs you are to detest.

9781,3026,1,Lev,11028,"Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. They are unclean for you."
9782,3027,1,Lev,11029," &lsquo;Of the animals that move about on the ground, these are unclean for you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard,"

9784,3029,1,Lev,11031,"Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening."
9785,3030,1,Lev,11032,"When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean."

9787,3032,1,Lev,11034,"Any food that could be eaten but has water on it from such a pot is unclean, and any liquid that could be drunk from it is unclean."
9788,3033,1,Lev,11035,"Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them as unclean."
9789,3034,1,Lev,11036,"A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean."

9811,3444,1,Lev,23041,You shall keep it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

9823,3456,1,Lev,24009,"And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the offerings of the LORD made by fire, by a perpetual statute.&rdquo;"
9824,3457,1,Lev,24010,"Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this Israelite woman&rsquo;s son and a man of Israel fought each other in the camp."
9825,3458,1,Lev,24011,"And the Israelite woman&rsquo;s son blasphemed the name of the LORD and cursed; and so they brought him to Moses. (His mother&rsquo;s name was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)"

9831,3464,1,Lev,24017,"&lsquo;Whoever kills any man shall surely be put to death."
9832,3465,1,Lev,24018,"Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, animal for animal."
9833,3466,1,Lev,24019,"&lsquo;If a man causes disfigurement of his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him &ndash; "

9835,3468,1,Lev,24021,"And whoever kills an animal shall restore it; but whoever kills a man shall be put to death."
9836,3469,1,Lev,24022,"You shall have the same law for the stranger and for one from your own country; for I am the LORD your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"

9864,3497,1,Lev,25027,"then let him count the years since its sale, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it, that he may return to his possession."
9865,3498,1,Lev,25028,"But if he is not able to have it restored to himself, then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Jubilee; and in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his possession."
9866,3499,1,Lev,25029,"&lsquo;If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year he may redeem it."

9868,3501,1,Lev,25031,"However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be counted as the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee."
9869,3502,1,Lev,25032,"Nevertheless the cities of the Lemvites, and the houses in the cities of their possession, the Lemvites may redeem at any time."
9870,3503,1,Lev,25033,"And if a man purchases a house from the Lemvites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses in the cities of the Lemvites are their possession among the children of Israel."
9871,3504,1,Lev,25034,"But the field of the common-land of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession."
9872,3505,1,Lev,25035,"&lsquo;If one of your brethren becomes poor, and falls into poverty among you, then you shall help him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you."

9877,3932,1,Num,7087,"All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve young bulls, the rams twelve, the male lambs in their first year twelve, with their grain offering, and the kids of the goats as a sin offering twelve."
9878,3933,1,Num,7088,"And all the oxen for the sacrifice of peace offerings were twenty-four bulls, the rams sixty, the male goats sixty, and the lambs in their first year sixty. This was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed."
9879,3934,1,Num,7089,"Now when Moses went into the tabernacle of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice of One speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim; thus He spoke to him."
9880,3935,1,Num,8001,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
9881,3936,1,Num,8002,"&ldquo;Speak to Aaron, and say to him, &lsquo;When you arrange the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9882,3937,1,Num,8003,"And Aaron did so; he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses."
9883,3938,1,Num,8004,"Now this workmanship of the lampstand was hammered gold; from its shaft to its flowers it was hammered work. According to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand."
9884,3939,1,Num,8005,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
9885,3940,1,Num,8006,"&ldquo;Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them ceremonially."

9887,3942,1,Num,8008,"Then let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering."

9891,3946,1,Num,8012,"Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites."
9892,3947,1,Num,8013,"&ldquo;And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them like a wave offering to the LORD."

9894,3949,1,Num,8015,After that the Levites shall go in to service the tabernacle of meeting. So you shall cleanse them and offer them like a wave offering.
9895,3950,1,Num,8016,"For they are wholly given to Me from among the children of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the children of Israel."
9896,3951,1,Num,8017,"For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to Myself."
9897,3952,1,Num,8018,I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
9898,3953,1,Num,8019,"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the work for the children of Israel in the tabernacle of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near the sanctuary.&rdquo;"
9899,3954,1,Num,8020,"Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them."
9900,3955,1,Num,8021,"And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them like a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them."
9901,3956,1,Num,8022,"After that the Levites went in to do their work in the tabernacle of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them."
9902,3957,1,Num,8023,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
9903,3958,1,Num,8024,"&ldquo;This is what pertains to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one may enter to perform service in the work of the tabernacle of meeting;"

9905,3960,1,Num,8026,"They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting, to attend to needs, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties.&rdquo;"
9906,3961,1,Num,9001,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:"

9909,3964,1,Num,9004,So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
9910,3965,1,Num,9005,"And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did."
9911,3966,1,Num,9006,"Now there were certain men who were defiled by a human corpse, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day."
9912,3967,1,Num,9007,"And those men said to him, &ldquo;We became defiled by a human corpse. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the children of Israel?&rdquo;"
9913,3968,1,Num,9008,"And Moses said to them, &ldquo;Stand still, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.&rdquo;"
9914,3969,1,Num,9009,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"

9917,3972,1,Num,9012,"They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break one of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it."
9918,3973,1,Num,9013,"But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and ceases to keep the Passover, that same person shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of the LORD at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin."
9919,3974,1,Num,9014,"&lsquo;And if a stranger dwells among you, and would keep the LORD&rsquo;s Passover, he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony; you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and the native of the land.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
9920,3975,1,Num,9015,"Now on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire."
9921,4416,1,Num,23007,"And he took up his oracle and said: &ldquo;Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, From the mountains of the east. &lsquo; Come, curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!&rsquo;"

9925,4420,1,Num,23011,"Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed them bountifully!&rdquo;"
9926,4421,1,Num,23012,"So he answered and said, &ldquo;Must I not take heed to speak what the LORD has put in my mouth?&rdquo;"
9927,4422,1,Num,23013,"Then Balak said to him, &ldquo;Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.&rdquo;"
9928,4423,1,Num,23014,"So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
9929,4424,1,Num,23015,"And he said to Balak, &ldquo;Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there.&rdquo;"
9930,4425,1,Num,23016,"Then the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, &ldquo;Go back to Balak, and thus you shall speak.&rdquo;"
9931,4426,1,Num,23017,"So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, &ldquo;What has the LORD spoken?&rdquo;"
9932,4427,1,Num,23018,"Then he took up his oracle and said: &ldquo;Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, son of Zippor!"
9933,4428,1,Num,23019,"&ldquo;God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?"
9934,4429,1,Num,23020,"Behold, I have received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it."
9935,4430,1,Num,23021,"&ldquo;He has not observed iniquity in Jacob, Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel. The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a King is among them."
9936,4431,1,Num,23022,"God brings them out of Egypt; He has strength like a wild ox."
9937,4432,1,Num,23023,"&ldquo;For there is no sorcery against Jacob, Nor any divination against Israel. It now must be said of Jacob And of Israel, &lsquo;Oh, what God has done!&rsquo;"

9939,4434,1,Num,23025,"Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!&rdquo;"
9940,4435,1,Num,23026,"So Balaam answered and said to Balak, &ldquo;Did I not tell you, saying, &lsquo;All that the LORD speaks, that I must do&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
9941,4436,1,Num,23027,"Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.&rdquo;"
9942,4437,1,Num,23028,"So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that overlooks the wasteland."
9943,4438,1,Num,23029,"Then Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.&rdquo;"
9944,4439,1,Num,23030,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on every altar."
9945,4440,1,Num,24001,"Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness."
9946,4441,1,Num,24002,"And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him."
9947,4442,1,Num,24003,"Then he took up his oracle and said: &ldquo;The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,"
9948,4443,1,Num,24004,"The utterance of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Who falls down, with eyes wide open:"
9949,4444,1,Num,24005,"&ldquo;How lovely are your tents, O Jacob! Your dwellings, O Israel!"
9950,4445,1,Num,24006,"Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens by the riverside, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters."
9951,4446,1,Num,24007,"He shall pour water from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters. &ldquo;His king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted."
9952,4447,1,Num,24008,"&ldquo;God brings him out of Egypt; He has strength like a wild ox; He shall consume the nations, his enemies; He shall break their bones And pierce them with his arrows."
9953,4448,1,Num,24009,"&lsquo;He bows down, he lies down as a lion; And as a lion, who shall rouse him?&rsquo; &ldquo; Blessed is he who blesses you, And cursed is he who curses you.&rdquo;"
9954,4449,1,Num,24010,"Then Balak&rsquo;s anger was aroused against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;I called you to curse my enemies, and look, you have bountifully blessed them these three times!"
9955,4450,1,Num,24011,"Now therefore, flee to your place. I said I would greatly honor you, but in fact, the LORD has kept you back from honor.&rdquo;"
9956,4451,1,Num,24012,"So Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,"
9957,4452,1,Num,24013,"&lsquo;If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD, to do good or bad of my own will. What the LORD says, that I must speak&rsquo;?"
9958,4453,1,Num,24014,"And now, indeed, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.&rdquo;"
9959,4454,1,Num,24015,"So he took up his oracle and said: &ldquo;The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;"

10136,11161,1,2Chr,7006,"And the priests attended to their services; the Levites also with instruments of the music of the Lord, which King David had made to praise the Lord, saying, For His mercy endures forever, whenever David offered praise by their ministry. The priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel stood. "
10137,11162,1,2Chr,7007,"Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat. "
10138,11163,1,2Chr,7008,"At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt. "
10139,11164,1,2Chr,7009,"And on the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. "
10140,11165,1,2Chr,7010,"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the Lord had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel. "
10141,11166,1,2Chr,7011,"Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king&rsquo;s house; and Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in the house of the Lord and in his own house. "
10142,11167,1,2Chr,7012,"Then the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. "
10143,11168,1,2Chr,7013,"When I shut up heaven and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people, "
10144,11169,1,2Chr,7014,"if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. "
10145,11170,1,2Chr,7015,Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer made in this place. 
10146,11171,1,2Chr,7016,"For now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that My name may be there forever; and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. "
10147,11172,1,2Chr,7017,"As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments, "
10148,11173,1,2Chr,7018,"then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, &lsquo;You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel.&rsquo; "
10149,11174,1,2Chr,7019,"But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them, "
10150,11175,1,2Chr,7020,"then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. "
10151,11176,1,2Chr,7021,"And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, &lsquo;Why has the Lord done thus to this land and this house?&rsquo; "
10152,11177,1,2Chr,7022,"Then they will answer, &lsquo;Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this calamity on them.&rsquo; "
10153,11178,1,2Chr,8001,"It came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the Lord and his own house, "
10154,11179,1,2Chr,8002,"that the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he settled the children of Israel there. "
10155,11180,1,2Chr,8003,And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it. 
10156,11181,1,2Chr,8004,"He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath. "
10157,11182,1,2Chr,8005,"He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, "
10158,11183,1,2Chr,8006,"also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the cavalry, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. "
10159,11184,1,2Chr,8007,"All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel &ndash; "
10160,11185,1,2Chr,8008,"that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel did not destroy &ndash; from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day. "
10161,11186,1,2Chr,8009,"But Solomon did not make the children of Israel servants for his work. Some were men of war, captains of his officers, captains of his chariots, and his cavalry. "
10162,11187,1,2Chr,8010,"And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people. "
10163,11188,1,2Chr,8011,"Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, &ldquo;My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of the Lord has come are holy.&rdquo; "
10164,11189,1,2Chr,8012,"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord which he had built before the vestibule, "
10165,11190,1,2Chr,8013,"according to the daily rate, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts &ndash; the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. "
10166,11191,1,2Chr,8014,"And, according to the order of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their duties (to praise and serve before the priests) as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for so David the man of God had commanded. "
10167,11192,1,2Chr,8015,They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries. 
10168,11193,1,2Chr,8016,Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered from the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord until it was finished. So the house of the Lord was completed. 
10169,11194,1,2Chr,8017,"Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom. "
10170,11195,1,2Chr,8018,"And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon. "
10171,11196,1,2Chr,9001,"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions, having a very great retinue, camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. "
10172,11197,1,2Chr,9002,"So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for Solomon that he could not explain it to her. "
10173,11198,1,2Chr,9003,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, "
10174,11199,1,2Chr,9004,"the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her. "
10175,11200,1,2Chr,9005,"Then she said to the king: &ldquo;It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. "
10176,11201,1,2Chr,9006,"However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame of which I heard. "
10177,11202,1,2Chr,9007,"Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! "
10178,11203,1,2Chr,9008,"Blessed be the Lord your God, who delighted in you, setting you on His throne to be king for the Lord your God! Because your God has loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.&rdquo; "
10179,11204,1,2Chr,9009,"And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there never were any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. "
10180,11205,1,2Chr,9010,"Also, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones. "
10181,11206,1,2Chr,9011,"And the king made walkways of the algum wood for the house of the Lord and for the king&rsquo;s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers; and there were none such as these seen before in the land of Judah. "
10182,11207,1,2Chr,9012,"Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, much more than she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. "
10183,11208,1,2Chr,9013,"The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, "
10184,11209,1,2Chr,9014,besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
10185,11210,1,2Chr,9015,"And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield. "
10186,11211,1,2Chr,9016,"He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. "
10187,11212,1,2Chr,9017,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. "
10188,11213,1,2Chr,9018,"The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests. "
10189,11214,1,2Chr,9019,"Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom. "
10190,11215,1,2Chr,9020,"All King Solomon&rsquo;s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. "
10191,11216,1,2Chr,9021,"For the king&rsquo;s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys."
10192,11217,1,2Chr,9022,So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
10193,13423,1,Job,31037,"I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him."
10194,13424,1,Job,31038,"&ldquo;If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together;"

10197,13427,1,Job,32001,"So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
10198,13428,1,Job,32002,"Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God."
10199,13429,1,Job,32003,"Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
10200,13430,1,Job,32004,"Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job."
10201,13431,1,Job,32005,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused."
10202,13432,1,Job,32006,"So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: &ldquo;I am young in years, and you are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you."
10203,13433,1,Job,32007,"I said, &lsquo;Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.&rsquo;"
10204,13434,1,Job,32008,"But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding."
10205,13435,1,Job,32009,"Great men are not always wise, Nor do the aged always understand justice."
10206,13436,1,Job,32010,"&ldquo;Therefore I say, &lsquo;Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.&rsquo;"
10207,13437,1,Job,32011,"Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say. "
10208,13438,1,Job,32012,"I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, Or answered his words &ndash; "
10209,13439,1,Job,32013,"Lest you say, &lsquo;We have found wisdom&rsquo;; God will vanquish him, not man."
10210,13440,1,Job,32014,"Now he has not directed his words against me; So I will not answer him with your words."
10211,13441,1,Job,32015,"&ldquo;They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them."
10212,13442,1,Job,32016,"And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still and answered no more."
10213,13443,1,Job,32017,"I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion."
10214,13444,1,Job,32018,"For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me."
10215,13445,1,Job,32019,"Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins."
10216,13446,1,Job,32020,"I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer."
10217,13447,1,Job,32021,"Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man."
10218,13448,1,Job,32022,"For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away."
10219,13449,1,Job,33001,"&ldquo;But please, Job, hear my speech, And listen to all my words."
10220,13450,1,Job,33002,"Now, I open my mouth; My tongue speaks in my mouth."
10221,13451,1,Job,33003,"My words come from my upright heart; My lips utter pure knowledge."
10222,13452,1,Job,33004,"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
10223,13453,1,Job,33005,"If you can answer me, Set your words in order before me; Take your stand."
10224,13454,1,Job,33006,"Truly I am as your spokesman before God; I also have been formed out of clay."
10225,13455,1,Job,33007,"Surely no fear of me will terrify you, Nor will my hand be heavy on you."
10226,13456,1,Job,33008,"&ldquo;Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words, saying,"

10228,13458,1,Job,33010,"Yet He finds occasions against me, He counts me as His enemy;"

10231,13461,1,Job,33013,Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give an accounting of any of His words.
10232,13462,1,Job,33014,"For God may speak in one way, or in another, Yet man does not perceive it."
10233,13463,1,Job,33015,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men, While slumbering on their beds,"
10234,13464,1,Job,33016,"Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction."
10235,13465,1,Job,33017,"In order to turn man from his deed, And conceal pride from man,"
10236,13466,1,Job,33018,"He keeps back his soul from the Pit, And his life from perishing by the sword."
10237,13467,1,Job,33019,"&ldquo;Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with strong pain in many of his bones,"
10238,13468,1,Job,33020,"So that his life abhors bread, And his soul succulent food."
10239,13469,1,Job,33021,"His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones stick out which once were not seen."
10240,13470,1,Job,33022,"Yes, his soul draws near the Pit, And his life to the executioners."
10241,13471,1,Job,33023,"&ldquo;If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness,"

10244,13474,1,Job,33026,"He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness."
10245,13475,1,Job,33027,"Then he looks at men and says, &lsquo;I have sinned, and perverted what was right, And it did not profit me.&rsquo;"
10246,13476,1,Job,33028,"He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, And his life shall see the light."
10247,13477,1,Job,33029,"&ldquo;Behold, God works all these things, Twice, in fact, three times with a man,"
10248,13478,1,Job,33030,"To bring back his soul from the Pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life."
10249,13479,1,Job,33031,"&ldquo;Give ear, Job, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will speak."
10250,13480,1,Job,33032,"If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you."
10251,13481,1,Job,33033,"If not, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.&rdquo;"
10252,13482,1,Job,34001,Elihu further answered and said:
10253,13483,1,Job,34002,"&ldquo;Hear my words, you wise men; Give ear to me, you who have knowledge."
10254,13484,1,Job,34003,For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food.
10255,13485,1,Job,34004,"Let us choose justice for ourselves; Let us know among ourselves what is good."
10256,13486,1,Job,34005,"&ldquo;For Job has said, &lsquo;I am righteous, But God has taken away my justice;"

10258,13488,1,Job,34007,"What man is like Job, Who drinks scorn like water,"

10260,13490,1,Job,34009,"For he has said, &lsquo;It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God.&rsquo;"
10261,13491,1,Job,34010,"&ldquo;Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to commit iniquity."
10262,13492,1,Job,34011,"For He repays man according to his work, And makes man to find a reward according to his way. "
10263,13493,1,Job,34012,"Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice."

10277,13507,1,Job,34026,"He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others,"

10730,3136,1,Lev,14024,"The priest is to take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering."
10731,3137,1,Lev,14025,"He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot."
10732,3138,1,Lev,14026,"The priest is to pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,"
10733,3139,1,Lev,14027,and with his right forefinger sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the LORD.
10734,3140,1,Lev,14028,"Some of the oil in his palm he is to put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering &ndash; on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot."

10736,3142,1,Lev,14030,"Then he shall sacrifice the doves or the young pigeons, which the person can afford,"
10737,3143,1,Lev,14031,"one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed."
10738,3144,1,Lev,14032,These are the regulations for anyone who has an infectious skin disease and who cannot afford the regular offerings for his cleansing.
10739,3145,1,Lev,14033,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,"
10740,3146,1,Lev,14034,"When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house in that land,"
10741,3147,1,Lev,14035,"the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, &lsquo;I have seen something that looks like mildew in my house.&rsquo;"
10742,3148,1,Lev,14036,"The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mildew, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house."
10743,3149,1,Lev,14037,"He is to examine the mildew on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall,"
10744,3150,1,Lev,14038,the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days.
10745,3151,1,Lev,14039,"On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls,"
10746,3152,1,Lev,14040,he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.
10747,3153,1,Lev,14041,He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town.
10748,3154,1,Lev,14042,Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.
10749,3155,1,Lev,14043,"If the mildew reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered,"
10750,3156,1,Lev,14044,"the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mildew has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew; the house is unclean."
10751,3157,1,Lev,14045,"It must be torn down &ndash; its stones, timbers and all the plaster &ndash; and taken out of the town to an unclean place."
10752,3158,1,Lev,14046,Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening.
10753,3159,1,Lev,14047,Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash his clothes.
10754,3160,1,Lev,14048,"But if the priest comes to examine it and the mildew has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the mildew is gone."
10755,3161,1,Lev,14049,"To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop."
10756,3162,1,Lev,14050,He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
10757,3163,1,Lev,14051,"Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times."
10758,3164,1,Lev,14052,"He shall purify the house with the bird&rsquo;s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn."
10759,3165,1,Lev,14053,"Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.&rdquo;"
10760,3166,1,Lev,14054,"These are the regulations for any infectious skin disease, for an itch,"

10762,3168,1,Lev,14056,"and for a swelling, a rash or a bright spot,"
10763,3169,1,Lev,14057,to determine when something is clean or unclean. These are the regulations for infectious skin diseases and mildew.
10764,3170,1,Lev,15001,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
10765,3171,1,Lev,15002,"&ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: &lsquo;When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean."

10782,7034,1,Judg,20001,"So all the children of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation gathered together as one man before the Lord at Mizpah. "
10783,7035,1,Judg,20002,"And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword. "
10784,7036,1,Judg,20003,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the children of Israel said, &ldquo;Tell us, how did this wicked deed happen?&rdquo; "
10785,7037,1,Judg,20004,"So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, &ldquo;My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night. "
10786,7038,1,Judg,20005,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died. "
10787,7039,1,Judg,20006,"So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, because they committed lewdness and outrage in Israel. "
10788,7040,1,Judg,20007,"Look! All of you are children of Israel; give your advice and counsel here and now!&rdquo; "
10789,7041,1,Judg,20008,"So all the people arose as one man, saying, &ldquo;None of us will go to his tent, nor will any turn back to his house; "
10790,7042,1,Judg,20009,but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot. 
10791,7043,1,Judg,20010,"We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to make provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel.&rdquo; "
10792,7044,1,Judg,20011,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man. "
10793,7045,1,Judg,20012,"Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, &ldquo;What is this wickedness that has occurred among you? "
10794,7046,1,Judg,20013,"Now therefore, deliver up the men, the perverted men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel!&rdquo; But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel. "
10795,7047,1,Judg,20014,"Instead, the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the children of Israel. "
10796,7048,1,Judg,20015,"And from their cities at that time the children of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred select men. "
10797,7049,1,Judg,20016,"Among all this people were seven hundred select men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair&rsquo;s breadth and not miss. "
10798,7050,1,Judg,20017,"Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war. "
10799,7051,1,Judg,20018,"Then the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God. They said, &ldquo;Which of us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin?&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;Judah first!&rdquo; "
10800,7052,1,Judg,20019,So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. 
10801,7053,1,Judg,20020,"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah. "
10802,7054,1,Judg,20021,"Then the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites. "
10803,7055,1,Judg,20022,"And the people, that is, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day. "
10804,7056,1,Judg,20023,"Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening, and asked counsel of the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Shall I again draw near for battle against the children of my brother Benjamin?&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;Go up against him.&rdquo; "
10805,7057,1,Judg,20024,So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day. 
10806,7058,1,Judg,20025,"And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel; all these drew the sword. "
10807,7059,1,Judg,20026,"Then all the children of Israel, that is, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. "
10808,7060,1,Judg,20027,"So the children of Israel inquired of the Lord (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, "
10809,7061,1,Judg,20028,"and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, &ldquo;Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.&rdquo; "
10810,7062,1,Judg,20029,Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah. 
10811,7063,1,Judg,20030,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times. "
10812,7064,1,Judg,20031,"So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel. "
10813,7065,1,Judg,20032,"And the children of Benjamin said, &ldquo;They are defeated before us, as at first.&rdquo; But the children of Israel said, &ldquo;Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.&rdquo; "
10814,7066,1,Judg,20033,"So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israel&rsquo;s men in ambush burst forth from their position in the plain of Geba. "
10815,7067,1,Judg,20034,"And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them. "
10816,7068,1,Judg,20035,"The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel. And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites; all these drew the sword. "
10817,7069,1,Judg,20036,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. "
10818,7070,1,Judg,20037,"And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword. "
10819,7071,1,Judg,20038,"Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city, "
10820,7072,1,Judg,20039,"whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they said, &ldquo;Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.&rdquo; "
10821,7073,1,Judg,20040,"But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven. "
10822,7074,1,Judg,20041,"And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin panicked, for they saw that disaster had come upon them. "
10823,7075,1,Judg,20042,"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst. "
10824,7076,1,Judg,20043,"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the east. "
10825,7077,1,Judg,20044,"And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor. "
10826,7078,1,Judg,20045,"Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways. Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom, and killed two thousand of them. "
10827,7079,1,Judg,20046,"So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor. "
10828,7080,1,Judg,20047,"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months. "
10829,7081,1,Judg,20048,"And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword &ndash; from every city, men and beasts, all who were found. They also set fire to all the cities they came to. "
10830,7082,1,Judg,21001,"Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, &ldquo;None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.&rdquo; "
10831,7083,1,Judg,21002,"Then the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly, "
10832,7084,1,Judg,21003,"and said, &ldquo;O Lord God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?&rdquo; "
10833,7085,1,Judg,21004,"So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. "
10834,7086,1,Judg,21005,"The children of Israel said, &ldquo;Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the Lord?&rdquo; For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, &ldquo;He shall surely be put to death.&rdquo; "
10835,7087,1,Judg,21006,"And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, &ldquo;One tribe is cut off from Israel today. "
10836,7088,1,Judg,21007,"What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?&rdquo; "
10837,7089,1,Judg,21008,"And they said, &ldquo;What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?&rdquo; And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. "
10838,7090,1,Judg,21009,"For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. "
10839,7091,1,Judg,21010,"So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. "
10840,7092,1,Judg,21011,"And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.&rdquo; "
10841,7093,1,Judg,21012,"So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. "
10842,7094,1,Judg,21013,"Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. "
10843,7095,1,Judg,21014,"So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. "
10844,7096,1,Judg,21015,"And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel. "
10845,7097,1,Judg,21016,"Then the elders of the congregation said, &ldquo;What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?&rdquo; "
10846,7098,1,Judg,21017,"And they said, &ldquo;There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. "
10847,7099,1,Judg,21018,"However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, &lsquo;Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
10848,7100,1,Judg,21019,"Then they said, &ldquo;In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.&rdquo; "
10849,7101,1,Judg,21020,"Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, &ldquo;Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, "
10850,7102,1,Judg,21021,"and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. "
10851,7103,1,Judg,21022,"Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, &lsquo;Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
10852,7104,1,Judg,21023,"And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. "
10853,7105,1,Judg,21024,"So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance. "
10854,7106,1,Judg,21025,"In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. "
10855,7107,1,Ruth,1001,"Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. "
10856,7108,1,Ruth,1002,"The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion &ndash; Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there. "
10857,7109,1,Ruth,1003,"Then Elimelech, Naomi&rsquo;s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. "
10858,7110,1,Ruth,1004,"Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years. "
10859,7111,1,Ruth,1005,"Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband. "
10860,7112,1,Ruth,1006,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited His people by giving them bread. "
10861,7113,1,Ruth,1007,"Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. "
10862,7114,1,Ruth,1008,"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, &ldquo;Go, return each to her mother&rsquo;s house. The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. "
10863,7115,1,Ruth,1009,"The Lord grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.&rdquo; Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. "
10864,7116,1,Ruth,1010,"And they said to her, &ldquo;Surely we will return with you to your people.&rdquo; "
10865,7117,1,Ruth,1011,"But Naomi said, &ldquo;Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? "

11133,2195,1,Exod,24017,The sight of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.
11134,2196,1,Exod,24018,So Moses went into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

11224,4648,1,Num,30008,"But if her husband overrules her on the day that he hears it, he shall make void her vow which she took and what she uttered with her lips, by which she bound herself, and the LORD will release her."
11225,4649,1,Num,30009,"&ldquo;Also any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her."

11244,4668,1,Num,31012,"Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho."
11245,4669,1,Num,31013,"And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp."
11246,4670,1,Num,31014,"But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who had come from the battle."

11248,4672,1,Num,31016,"Look, these women caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the incident of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD."
11249,4673,1,Num,31017,"Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately."
11250,4674,1,Num,31018,But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man intimately.
11251,4675,1,Num,31019,"And as for you, remain outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day."
11252,4676,1,Num,31020,"Purify every garment, everything made of leather, everything woven of goats&rsquo; hair, and everything made of wood.&rdquo;"
11253,4677,1,Num,31021,"Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, &ldquo;This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses:"

11256,4680,1,Num,31024,"And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp.&rdquo;"

11280,7701,1,1Kg,19016,"And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a cover of goats&rsquo; hair for his head. "
11281,7702,1,1Kg,19017,"Then Saul said to Michal, &ldquo;Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped?&rdquo; And Michal answered Saul, &ldquo;He said to me, &lsquo;Let me go! Why should I kill you?&rsquo; &ldquo; "
11282,7703,1,1Kg,19018,"So David fled and escaped, and went to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. "
11283,7704,1,1Kg,19019,"Now it was told Saul, saying, &ldquo;Take note, David is at Naioth in Ramah!&rdquo; "
11284,7705,1,1Kg,19020,"Then Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as leader over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. "
11285,7706,1,1Kg,19021,"And when Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. "
11286,7707,1,1Kg,19022,"Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is at Sechu. So he asked, and said, &ldquo;Where are Samuel and David?&rdquo; And someone said, &ldquo;Indeed they are at Naioth in Ramah.&rdquo; "
11287,7708,1,1Kg,19023,"So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah. "
11288,7709,1,1Kg,19024,"And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, &ldquo;Is Saul also among the prophets?&rdquo;"
11289,7710,1,1Kg,20001,"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and went and said to Jonathan, &ldquo;What have I done? What is my iniquity, and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?&rdquo; "
11290,7711,1,1Kg,20002,"So Jonathan said to him, &ldquo;By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!&rdquo; "
11291,7712,1,1Kg,20003,"Then David took an oath again, and said, &ldquo;Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, &lsquo;Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.&rsquo; But truly, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.&rdquo; "
11292,7713,1,1Kg,20004,"So Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Whatever you yourself desire, I will do it for you.&rdquo; "
11293,7714,1,1Kg,20005,"And David said to Jonathan, &ldquo;Indeed tomorrow is the New Moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go, that I may hide in the field until the third day at evening. "
11294,7715,1,1Kg,20006,"If your father misses me at all, then say, &lsquo;David earnestly asked permission of me that he might run over to Bethlehem, his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.&rsquo; "
11295,7716,1,1Kg,20007,"If he says thus: &lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; your servant will be safe. But if he is very angry, then be sure that evil is determined by him. "
11296,7717,1,1Kg,20008,"Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you. Nevertheless, if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?&rdquo; "
11297,7718,1,1Kg,20009,"But Jonathan said, &ldquo;Far be it from you! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?&rdquo; "
11298,7719,1,1Kg,20010,"Then David said to Jonathan, &ldquo;Who will tell me, or what if your father answers you roughly?&rdquo; "
11299,7720,1,1Kg,20011,"And Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Come, and let us go out into the field.&rdquo; So both of them went out into the field. "
11300,7721,1,1Kg,20012,"Then Jonathan said to David: &ldquo;The Lord God of Israel is witness! When I have sounded out my father sometime tomorrow, or the third day, and indeed there is good toward David, and I do not send to you and tell you, "
11301,7722,1,1Kg,20013,"may the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father to do you evil, then I will report it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And the Lord be with you as He has been with my father. "
11302,7723,1,1Kg,20014,"And you shall not only show me the kindness of the Lord while I still live, that I may not die; "
11303,7724,1,1Kg,20015,"but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the Lord has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.&rdquo; "
11304,7725,1,1Kg,20016,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, &ldquo;Let the Lord require it at the hand of David&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo; "
11305,7726,1,1Kg,20017,"Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul. "
11306,7727,1,1Kg,20018,"Then Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Tomorrow is the New Moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. "
11307,7728,1,1Kg,20019,"And when you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed; and remain by the stone Ezel. "
11308,7729,1,1Kg,20020,"Then I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target; "
11309,7730,1,1Kg,20021,"and there I will send a lad, saying, &lsquo;Go, find the arrows.&rsquo; If I expressly say to him, &lsquo;Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them and come&rsquo; &ndash; then, as the Lord lives, there is safety for you and no harm. "
11310,7731,1,1Kg,20022,"But if I say thus to the young man, &lsquo;Look, the arrows are beyond you&rsquo; &ndash; go your way, for the Lord has sent you away. "
11311,7732,1,1Kg,20023,"And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, indeed the Lord be between you and me forever.&rdquo; "
11312,7733,1,1Kg,20024,"Then David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat the feast. "
11313,7734,1,1Kg,20025,"Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul&rsquo;s side, but David&rsquo;s place was empty. "
11314,7735,1,1Kg,20026,"Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, &ldquo;Something has happened to him; he is unclean, surely he is unclean.&rdquo; "
11315,7736,1,1Kg,20027,"And it happened the next day, the second day of the month, that David&rsquo;s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, &ldquo;Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat, either yesterday or today?&rdquo; "
11316,7737,1,1Kg,20028,"So Jonathan answered Saul, &ldquo;David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem. "
11317,7738,1,1Kg,20029,"And he said, &lsquo;Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me get away and see my brothers.&rsquo; Therefore he has not come to the king&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; "
11318,7739,1,1Kg,20030,"Then Saul&rsquo;s anger was aroused against Jonathan, and he said to him, &ldquo;You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother&rsquo;s nakedness? "
11319,7740,1,1Kg,20031,"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.&rdquo; "
11320,7741,1,1Kg,20032,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, &ldquo;Why should he be killed? What has he done?&rdquo; "
11321,7742,1,1Kg,20033,"Then Saul cast a spear at him to kill him, by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David. "
11322,7743,1,1Kg,20034,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully. "
11323,7744,1,1Kg,20035,"And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad was with him. "
11324,7745,1,1Kg,20036,"Then he said to his lad, &ldquo;Now run, find the arrows which I shoot.&rdquo; As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. "
11325,7746,1,1Kg,20037,"When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, &ldquo;Is not the arrow beyond you?&rdquo; "
11326,7747,1,1Kg,20038,"And Jonathan cried out after the lad, &ldquo;Make haste, hurry, do not delay!&rdquo; So Jonathan&rsquo;s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master. "
11327,7748,1,1Kg,20039,But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter. 
11328,7749,1,1Kg,20040,"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, &ldquo;Go, carry them to the city.&rdquo; "
11329,7750,1,1Kg,20041,"As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from a place toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so. "
11330,7751,1,1Kg,20042,"Then Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, &lsquo;May the Lord be between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants, forever.&rsquo; &ldquo; So he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city. "
11331,7752,1,1Kg,21001,"Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech was afraid when he met David, and said to him, &ldquo;Why are you alone, and no one is with you?&rdquo; "
11332,7753,1,1Kg,21002,"So David said to Ahimelech the priest, &ldquo;The king has ordered me on some business, and said to me, &lsquo;Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you, or what I have commanded you.&rsquo; And I have directed my young men to such and such a place. "
11333,7754,1,1Kg,21003,"Now therefore, what have you on hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever can be found.&rdquo; "
11334,7755,1,1Kg,21004,"And the priest answered David and said, &ldquo;There is no common bread on hand; but there is holy bread, if the young men have at least kept themselves from women.&rdquo; "
11335,7756,1,1Kg,21005,"Then David answered the priest, and said to him, &ldquo;Truly, women have been kept from us about three days since I came out. And the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in effect common, even though it was sanctified in the vessel this day.&rdquo; "
11336,7757,1,1Kg,21006,"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread which had been taken from before the Lord, in order to put hot bread in its place on the day when it was taken away. "
11337,7758,1,1Kg,21007,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord. And his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul. "
11338,7759,1,1Kg,21008,"And David said to Ahimelech, &ldquo;Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&rsquo;s business required haste.&rdquo; "
11339,7760,1,1Kg,21009,"So the priest said, &ldquo;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, there it is, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it. For there is no other except that one here.&rdquo; And David said, &ldquo;There is none like it; give it to me.&rdquo; "
11340,7761,1,1Kg,21010,"Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. "
11341,7762,1,1Kg,21011,"And the servants of Achish said to him, &ldquo;Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances, saying: &lsquo;Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
11342,7763,1,1Kg,21012,"Now David took these words to heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. "
11343,7764,1,1Kg,21013,"So he changed his behavior before them, feigned madness in their hands, scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva fall down on his beard. "
11344,7765,1,1Kg,21014,"Then Achish said to his servants, &ldquo;Look, you see the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me? "
11345,7836,1,1Kg,24018,"And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when the Lord delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me. "
11346,7837,1,1Kg,24019,"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him get away safely? Therefore may the Lord reward you with good for what you have done to me this day. "

11359,15010,1,Isa,16013,This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning Moab since that time.
11360,15011,1,Isa,16014,"But now the Lord has spoken, saying, &ldquo;Within three years, as the years of a hired man, the glory of Moab will be despised with all that great multitude, and the remnant will be very small and feeble.&rdquo;"

11543,9559,1,4Kg,5018,"Yet in this thing may the Lord pardon your servant: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon &ndash; when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord please pardon your servant in this thing.&rdquo; "
11544,9560,1,4Kg,5019,"Then he said to him, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo; So he departed from him a short distance. "
11545,9561,1,4Kg,5020,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, &ldquo;Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him.&rdquo; "
11546,9562,1,4Kg,5021,"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, &ldquo;Is all well?&rdquo; "
11547,9563,1,4Kg,5022,"And he said, &ldquo;All is well. My master has sent me, saying, &lsquo;Indeed, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
11548,9564,1,4Kg,5023,"So Naaman said, &ldquo;Please, take two talents.&rdquo; And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants; and they carried them on ahead of him. "
11549,9565,1,4Kg,5024,"When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand, and stored them away in the house; then he let the men go, and they departed. "
11550,9566,1,4Kg,5025,"Now he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, &ldquo;Where did you go, Gehazi?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Your servant did not go anywhere.&rdquo; "
11551,9567,1,4Kg,5026,"Then he said to him, &ldquo;Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants? "
11552,9568,1,4Kg,5027,"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.&rdquo; And he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow. "
11553,9569,1,4Kg,6001,"And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, &ldquo;See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us. "
11554,9570,1,4Kg,6002,"Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.&rdquo; So he answered, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; "
11555,9571,1,4Kg,6003,"Then one said, &ldquo;Please consent to go with your servants.&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; "
11556,9572,1,4Kg,6004,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. "
11557,9573,1,4Kg,6005,"But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, &ldquo;Alas, master! For it was borrowed.&rdquo; "
11558,9574,1,4Kg,6006,"So the man of God said, &ldquo;Where did it fall?&rdquo; And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float. "
11559,9575,1,4Kg,6007,"Therefore he said, &ldquo;Pick it up for yourself.&rdquo; So he reached out his hand and took it. "
11560,9576,1,4Kg,6008,"Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, &ldquo;My camp will be in such and such a place.&rdquo; "
11561,9577,1,4Kg,6009,"And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.&rdquo; "
11562,9578,1,4Kg,6010,"Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice. "
11563,9579,1,4Kg,6011,"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, &ldquo;Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?&rdquo; "
11564,9580,1,4Kg,6012,"And one of his servants said, &ldquo;None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.&rdquo; "
11565,9581,1,4Kg,6013,"So he said, &ldquo;Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.&rdquo; And it was told him, saying, &ldquo;Surely he is in Dothan.&rdquo; "
11566,9582,1,4Kg,6014,"Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. "
11567,9583,1,4Kg,6015,"And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, &ldquo;Alas, my master! What shall we do?&rdquo; "
11568,9584,1,4Kg,6016,"So he answered, &ldquo;Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.&rdquo; "
11569,9585,1,4Kg,6017,"And Elisha prayed, and said, &ldquo;Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.&rdquo; Then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. "
11570,9586,1,4Kg,6018,"So when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, and said, &ldquo;Strike this people, I pray, with blindness.&rdquo; And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. "
11571,9587,1,4Kg,6019,"Now Elisha said to them, &ldquo;This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.&rdquo; But he led them to Samaria. "
11572,9588,1,4Kg,6020,"So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, &ldquo;Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.&rdquo; And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and there they were, inside Samaria! "
11573,9589,1,4Kg,6021,"Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, &ldquo;My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?&rdquo; "
11574,9590,1,4Kg,6022,"But he answered, &ldquo;You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.&rdquo; "
11575,9591,1,4Kg,6023,"Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel. "
11576,9592,1,4Kg,6024,"And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria. "
11577,9593,1,4Kg,6025,"And there was a great famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey&rsquo;s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver. "
11578,9594,1,4Kg,6026,"Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, &ldquo;Help, my lord, O king!&rdquo; "
11579,9595,1,4Kg,6027,"And he said, &ldquo;If the Lord does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?&rdquo; "
11580,9596,1,4Kg,6028,"Then the king said to her, &ldquo;What is troubling you?&rdquo; And she answered, &ldquo;This woman said to me, &lsquo;Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.&rsquo; "
11581,9597,1,4Kg,6029,"So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, &lsquo;Give your son, that we may eat him&rsquo;; but she has hidden her son.&rdquo; "
11582,9598,1,4Kg,6030,"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body. "
11583,9599,1,4Kg,6031,"Then he said, &ldquo;God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.&rdquo; "
11584,9600,1,4Kg,6032,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, &ldquo;Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master&rsquo;s feet behind him?&rdquo; "
11585,9601,1,4Kg,6033,"And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then the king said, &ldquo;Surely this calamity is from the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?&rdquo; "
11586,9602,1,4Kg,7001,"Then Elisha said, &ldquo;Hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
11587,9603,1,4Kg,7002,"So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, &ldquo;Look, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, could this thing be?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;In fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.&rdquo; "

11698,13415,1,Job,31029,"&ldquo;If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, Or lifted myself up when evil found him"
11699,13416,1,Job,31030,"(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his soul);"
11700,13417,1,Job,31031,"If the men of my tent have not said, &lsquo;Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?&rsquo;"
11701,13418,1,Job,31032,"(But no sojourner had to lodge in the street, For I have opened my doors to the traveler);"
11702,13419,1,Job,31033,"If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,"
11703,13420,1,Job,31034,"Because I feared the great multitude, And dreaded the contempt of families, So that I kept silence And did not go out of the door &ndash; "
11704,13421,1,Job,31035,"Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my mark. Oh, that the Almighty would answer me, That my Prosecutor had written a book!"
11705,13422,1,Job,31036,"Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, And bind it on me like a crown;"
11706,13516,1,Job,34035,"&lsquo;Job speaks without knowledge, His words are without wisdom.&rsquo;"
11707,13517,1,Job,34036,"Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, Because his answers are like those of wicked men!"
11708,13518,1,Job,34037,"For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.&rdquo; "
11709,13519,1,Job,35001,Moreover Elihu answered and said:
11710,13520,1,Job,35002,"&ldquo;Do you think this is right? Do you say, &lsquo;My righteousness is more than God&rsquo;s&rsquo;?"
11711,13521,1,Job,35003,"For you say, &lsquo;What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?&rsquo;"
11712,13522,1,Job,35004,"&ldquo;I will answer you, And your companions with you."
11713,13523,1,Job,35005,"Look to the heavens and see; And behold the clouds &ndash; They are higher than you."
11714,13524,1,Job,35006,"If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?"
11715,13525,1,Job,35007,"If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?"
11716,13526,1,Job,35008,"Your wickedness affects a man such as you, And your righteousness a son of man."
11717,13527,1,Job,35009,"&ldquo;Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty."
11718,13528,1,Job,35010,"But no one says, &lsquo;Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,"
11719,13529,1,Job,35011,"Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?&rsquo;"
11720,13530,1,Job,35012,"There they cry out, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men."
11721,13531,1,Job,35013,"Surely God will not listen to empty talk, Nor will the Almighty regard it."
11722,13532,1,Job,35014,"Although you say you do not see Him, Yet justice is before Him, and you must wait for Him."
11723,13533,1,Job,35015,"And now, because He has not punished in His anger, Nor taken much notice of folly,"
11724,13534,1,Job,35016,"Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge.&rdquo;"
11725,13535,1,Job,36001,Elihu also proceeded and said: 
11726,13536,1,Job,36002,"&ldquo;Bear with me a little, and I will show you That there are yet words to speak on God&rsquo;s behalf."
11727,13537,1,Job,36003,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
11728,13538,1,Job,36004,"For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you."
11729,13539,1,Job,36005,"&ldquo;Behold, God is mighty, but despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding."
11730,13540,1,Job,36006,"He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives justice to the oppressed."
11731,13541,1,Job,36007,"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But they are on the throne with kings, For He has seated them forever, And they are exalted."
11732,13542,1,Job,36008,"And if they are bound in fetters, Held in the cords of affliction,"
11733,13543,1,Job,36009,"Then He tells them their work and their transgressions &ndash; That they have acted defiantly."
11734,13544,1,Job,36010,"He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity."
11735,13545,1,Job,36011,"If they obey and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures."
11736,13546,1,Job,36012,"But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge."
11737,13547,1,Job,36013,"&ldquo;But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; They do not cry for help when He binds them. "
11738,13548,1,Job,36014,"They die in youth, And their life ends among the perverted persons."
11739,13549,1,Job,36015,"He delivers the poor in their affliction, And opens their ears in oppression."
11740,13550,1,Job,36016,"&ldquo;Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, Into a broad place where there is no restraint; And what is set on your table would be full of richness."
11741,13551,1,Job,36017,"But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you."
11742,13552,1,Job,36018,"Because there is wrath, beware lest He take you away with one blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid it. "
11743,13553,1,Job,36019,"Will your riches, Or all the mighty forces, Keep you from distress?"
11744,13554,1,Job,36020,"Do not desire the night, When people are cut off in their place."
11745,13555,1,Job,36021,"Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, For you have chosen this rather than affliction."
11746,13556,1,Job,36022,"&ldquo;Behold, God is exalted by His power; Who teaches like Him?"
11747,13557,1,Job,36023,"Who has assigned Him His way, Or who has said, &lsquo;You have done wrong&rsquo;?"
11748,13558,1,Job,36024,"&ldquo;Remember to magnify His work, Of which men have sung."
11749,13559,1,Job,36025,"Everyone has seen it; Man looks on it from afar."
11750,13560,1,Job,36026,"&ldquo;Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him; Nor can the number of His years be discovered."
11751,13561,1,Job,36027,"For He draws up drops of water, Which distill as rain from the mist,"
11752,13562,1,Job,36028,Which the clouds drop down And pour abundantly on man.
11753,13563,1,Job,36029,"Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds, The thunder from His canopy?"
11754,13564,1,Job,36030,"Look, He scatters His light upon it, And covers the depths of the sea."
11755,13565,1,Job,36031,"For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance."
11756,13566,1,Job,36032,"He covers His hands with lightning, And commands it to strike."
11757,13567,1,Job,36033,"His thunder declares it, The cattle also, concerning the rising storm."
11758,13568,1,Job,37001,"&ldquo;At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place."
11759,13569,1,Job,37002,"Hear attentively the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that comes from His mouth."
11760,13570,1,Job,37003,"He sends it forth under the whole heaven, His lightning to the ends of the earth."
11761,13571,1,Job,37004,"After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard."
11762,13572,1,Job,37005,"God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend."
11763,13573,1,Job,37006,"For He says to the snow, &lsquo;Fall on the earth&rsquo;; Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength."
11764,13574,1,Job,37007,"He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work."
11765,13575,1,Job,37008,"The beasts go into dens, And remain in their lairs."
11766,13576,1,Job,37009,"From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind, And cold from the scattering winds of the north."
11767,13577,1,Job,37010,"By the breath of God ice is given, And the broad waters are frozen."
11768,13578,1,Job,37011,"Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds; He scatters His bright clouds."
11769,13579,1,Job,37012,"And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of the whole earth."
11770,13580,1,Job,37013,"He causes it to come, Whether for correction, Or for His land, Or for mercy."
11771,13581,1,Job,37014,"&ldquo;Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God."
11772,13582,1,Job,37015,"Do you know when God dispatches them, And causes the light of His cloud to shine?"
11773,13583,1,Job,37016,"Do you know how the clouds are balanced, Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?"
11774,13584,1,Job,37017,"Why are your garments hot, When He quiets the earth by the south wind?"
11775,2694,1,Exod,39029,"and a sash of fine woven linen with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, made by a weaver, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11776,2695,1,Exod,39030,"Then they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription like the engraving of a signet:"
11777,2696,1,Exod,39031,"And they tied to it a blue cord, to fasten it above on the turban, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11778,2697,1,Exod,39032,"Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished. And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses; so they did."
11779,2698,1,Exod,39033,"And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;"
11780,2699,1,Exod,39034,"the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering;"
11781,2700,1,Exod,39035,"the ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the mercy seat;"
11782,2701,1,Exod,39036,"the table, all its utensils, and the showbread;"
11783,2702,1,Exod,39037,"the pure gold lampstand with its lamps (the lamps set in order), all its utensils, and the oil for light;"
11784,2703,1,Exod,39038,"the gold altar, the anointing oil, and the sweet incense; the screen for the tabernacle door;"
11785,2704,1,Exod,39039,"the bronze altar, its grate of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver with its base;"
11786,2705,1,Exod,39040,"the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, the screen for the court gate, its cords, and its pegs; all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;"
11787,2706,1,Exod,39041,"and the garments of ministry, to minister in the holy place: the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons&rsquo; garments, to minister as priests."
11788,2707,1,Exod,39042,"According to all that the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work."
11789,2708,1,Exod,39043,"Then Moses looked over all the work, and indeed they had done it; as the Lord had commanded, just so they had done it. And Moses blessed them."
11790,2709,1,Exod,40001,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:"
11791,2710,1,Exod,40002,"&ldquo;On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting."
11792,2711,1,Exod,40003,"&ldquo;You shall put in it the ark of the Testimony, and partition off the ark with the veil."
11793,2712,1,Exod,40004,"&ldquo;You shall bring in the table and arrange the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and light its lamps."
11794,2713,1,Exod,40005,"&ldquo;You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and put up the screen for the door of the tabernacle."
11795,2714,1,Exod,40006,"&ldquo;Then you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting."
11796,2715,1,Exod,40007,"&ldquo;And you shall set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water in it."
11797,2716,1,Exod,40008,"&ldquo;You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen at the court gate."
11798,2717,1,Exod,40009,"&ldquo;And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it; and you shall hallow it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy."
11799,2718,1,Exod,40010,"&ldquo;You shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar. The altar shall be most holy."
11800,2719,1,Exod,40011,"&ldquo;And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it."
11801,2720,1,Exod,40012,"&ldquo;Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of meeting and wash them with water."
11802,2721,1,Exod,40013,"&ldquo;You shall put the holy garments on Aaron, and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister to Me as priest."
11803,2722,1,Exod,40014,"&ldquo;And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics."
11804,2723,1,Exod,40015,"&ldquo;You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to Me as priests; for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.&rdquo;"
11805,2724,1,Exod,40016,"Thus Moses did; according to all that the Lord had commanded him, so he did."
11806,2725,1,Exod,40017,"And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up."
11807,2726,1,Exod,40018,"So Moses raised up the tabernacle, fastened its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars."
11808,2727,1,Exod,40019,"And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11809,2728,1,Exod,40020,"He took the Testimony and put it into the ark, inserted the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark."
11810,2729,1,Exod,40021,"And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung up the veil of the covering, and partitioned off the ark of the Testimony, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11811,2730,1,Exod,40022,"He put the table in the tabernacle of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil;"
11812,2731,1,Exod,40023,"and he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11813,2732,1,Exod,40024,"He put the lampstand in the tabernacle of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle;"
11814,2733,1,Exod,40025,"and he lit the lamps before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11815,2734,1,Exod,40026,"He put the gold altar in the tabernacle of meeting in front of the veil;"
11816,2735,1,Exod,40027,"and he burned sweet incense on it, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11817,2736,1,Exod,40028,He hung up the screen at the door of the tabernacle.
11818,2737,1,Exod,40029,"And he put the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11819,2738,1,Exod,40030,"He set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water there for washing;"
11820,2739,1,Exod,40031,"and Moses, Aaron, and his sons would wash their hands and their feet with water from it."
11821,2740,1,Exod,40032,"Whenever they went into the tabernacle of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
11822,2741,1,Exod,40033,"And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the screen of the court gate. So Moses finished the work."
11823,2742,1,Exod,40034,"Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
11824,2743,1,Exod,40035,"And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of meeting, because the cloud rested above it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
11825,2744,1,Exod,40036,"Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would go onward in all their journeys."
11826,2745,1,Exod,40037,"But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey till the day that it was taken up."
11827,2746,1,Exod,40038,"For the cloud of the Lord was above the tabernacle by day, and fire was over it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
11828,2747,1,Lev,1001,"Now the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying,"
11829,2748,1,Lev,1002,"&ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: &lsquo;When any one of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the livestock &ndash; of the herd and of the flock."
11830,2749,1,Lev,1003,"&lsquo;If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD."
11831,2750,1,Lev,1004,"Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him."
11832,2751,1,Lev,1005,"He shall kill the bull before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
11833,2752,1,Lev,1006,And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
11834,2753,1,Lev,1007,"The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire."
11835,2754,1,Lev,1008,"Then the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;"
11836,2755,1,Lev,1009,"but he shall wash its entrails and its legs with water. And the priest shall burn all on the altar as a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
11837,2756,1,Lev,1010,"&lsquo;If his offering is of the flocks &ndash; of the sheep or of the goats &ndash; as a burnt sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish."
11838,2757,1,Lev,1011,"He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron&rsquo;s sons, shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar."
11839,2758,1,Lev,1012,"And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;"
11840,2759,1,Lev,1013,"but he shall wash the entrails and the legs with water. Then the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
11841,2760,1,Lev,1014,"&lsquo;And if the burnt sacrifice of his offering to the LORD is of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons."
11842,2761,1,Lev,1015,"The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar."
11843,2762,1,Lev,1016,"And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar on the east side, into the place for ashes."
11844,2763,1,Lev,1017,"Then he shall split it at its wings, but shall not divide it completely; and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
11845,2764,1,Lev,2001,"&lsquo;When anyone offers a grain offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it."
11846,2765,1,Lev,2002,"He shall bring it to Aaron&rsquo;s sons, the priests, one of whom shall take from it his handful of fine flour and oil with all the frankincense. And the priest shall burn it as a memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
11847,2766,1,Lev,2003,"The rest of the grain offering shall be Aaron&rsquo;s and his sons&rsquo;. It is most holy of the offerings to the LORD made by fire."
11848,2767,1,Lev,2004,"&lsquo;And if you bring as an offering a grain offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil."
11849,2768,1,Lev,2005,"But if your offering is a grain offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil."
11850,2769,1,Lev,2006,"You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering."
11851,2770,1,Lev,2007,"&lsquo;If your offering is a grain offering baked in a covered pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
11852,2771,1,Lev,2008,"You shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the LORD. And when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar."
11853,2772,1,Lev,2009,"Then the priest shall take from the grain offering a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."
11854,2773,1,Lev,2010,"And what is left of the grain offering shall be Aaron&rsquo;s and his sons&rsquo;. It is most holy of the offerings to the LORD made by fire."
11855,2774,1,Lev,2011,"No grain offering which you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey in any offering to the LORD made by fire."

11879,7511,1,1Kg,14024,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had placed the people under oath, saying, &ldquo;Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.&rdquo; So none of the people tasted food. "

11886,7518,1,1Kg,14031,Now they had driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. So the people were very faint.

11890,7522,1,1Kg,14035,Then Saul built an altar to the Lord. This was the first altar that he built to the Lord.

12419,4554,1,Num,27008,"And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: &lsquo;If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter."
12420,4555,1,Num,27009,"If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers."
12421,4556,1,Num,27010,"If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father&rsquo;s brothers."
12422,4557,1,Num,27011,"And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it.&rsquo;&rdquo; And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
12423,4558,1,Num,27012,"Now the LORD said to Moses: &ldquo;Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel."
12424,4559,1,Num,27013,"And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered."
12425,4560,1,Num,27014,"For in the Wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to hallow Me at the waters before their eyes.&rdquo; (These are the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.)"
12426,4561,1,Num,27015,"Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying:"

13179,15120,1,Isa,23015,"Now it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:"

13212,17289,1,Dan,2034,"You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces."
13213,17290,1,Dan,2035,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
13214,17291,1,Dan,2036,"&ldquo;This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king."

13217,17294,1,Dan,3001,"King Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."
13218,17295,1,Dan,3002,"Then King Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar had set up."
13219,17296,1,Dan,3003,"Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar had set up."
13220,17297,1,Dan,3004,"And the herald proclaimed aloud, &ldquo;You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,"
13221,17298,1,Dan,3005,"that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar has set up;"
13222,17299,1,Dan,3006,"and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace&rdquo;."
13223,17300,1,Dan,3007,"Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image which King Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar had set up."
13224,17301,1,Dan,3008,"Therefore at the time certain Chalde&rsquo;ans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews."
13225,17302,1,Dan,3009,"They said to King Nabuchadnez&rsquo;zar, &ldquo;O king live for ever!"
13226,17303,1,Dan,3010,"You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;"
13227,17304,1,Dan,3011,and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.
13228,17305,1,Dan,3012,"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&rsquo;nego. These men, O king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&rdquo;"
13229,17306,1,Dan,3013,"Then Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&rsquo;nego brought. Then they brought these men before the king."
13230,17307,1,Dan,3014,"Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar said to them, &ldquo;Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&rsquo;nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?"
13231,17308,1,Dan,3015,"Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?&rdquo;"
13232,17309,1,Dan,3016,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&rsquo;nego answered the king, &ldquo;O Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar, we have no need to answer you in this matter."
13233,17310,1,Dan,3017,"If it be so, our God who we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
13234,17311,1,Dan,3018,"But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&rdquo;"
13235,17312,1,Dan,3019,"Then Nebuchadnez&rsquo;zar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&rsquo;nego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated."
13236,17313,1,Dan,3020,"And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
13237,17314,1,Dan,3021,"Then these men were bound in their mantles, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning fiery furnace."
13238,17315,1,Dan,3022,"Because the king&rsquo;s order was strict and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
13239,17316,1,Dan,3023,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace."
13240,17317,1,Dan,3024,"And they walked about in the midst of the flames, singing hymns to God and blessing the Lord."
13241,17318,1,Dan,3025,"Then Azariah <em><sup>[This section is from the Greek Septuagint, which uses the names Hananiah (Shadrach), Mishael (Meshach), and Azariah (Abed&rsquo;nego) in place of the Hebrew-Babylonian forms]</sup></em> stood and offered this prayer, in the midst of the fire he opened his mouth and said:"
13242,17319,1,Dan,3026,"&ldquo;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and worthy of praise; and Thy name is glorified for ever."
13243,17320,1,Dan,3027,"&ldquo;For Thou art just in all that Thou has done to us, and all Thy works are true and Thy ways right, and all Thy judgments are truth."
13244,17321,1,Dan,3028,"&ldquo;Thou has executed true judgments in all that Thou hast brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers, for in truth and justice Thou has brought all this upon us because of our sins."
13245,17322,1,Dan,3029,"&ldquo;For we have sinfully and lawlessly departed from Thee, and have sinned in all things and have not obeyed Thy commandments;"
13246,17323,1,Dan,3030,"we have not observed them or done them, as Thou has commanded us that it might go well with us."
13247,17324,1,Dan,3031,"&ldquo;So all that Thou hast brought upon us, and all that Thou hast done to us, Thou has done in true judgment."
13248,17325,1,Dan,3032,"&ldquo;Thou hast given us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world."
13249,17326,1,Dan,3033,"And now we cannot open our mouths; shame and disgrace have befallen Thy servants and worshipers."
13250,17327,1,Dan,3034,"&ldquo;For Thy name&rsquo;s sake do not give us up utterly, and do not break Thy covenant,"
13251,17328,1,Dan,3035,"and do not withdraw Thy mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham Thy beloved and for the sake of Isaac Thy servant and Israel Thy holy one,"
13252,17329,1,Dan,3036,to whom Thou didst promise to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the shore of the sea.
13253,17330,1,Dan,3037,"&ldquo;For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins."
13254,17331,1,Dan,3038,"&ldquo;And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader, no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make an offering before Thee or to find mercy."
13255,17332,1,Dan,3039,"&ldquo;Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted,"
13256,17333,1,Dan,3040," as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, and with tens of thousands of fat lambs; such may our sacrifice be in Thy sight this day, and may we wholly follow Thee, for there will be no shame for those who trust in Thee."
13257,17334,1,Dan,3041,"&ldquo;And now with all our heart we follow Thee, we fear Thee and seek Thy face."
13258,17335,1,Dan,3042,"&ldquo;Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in Thy forbearance and in Thy abundant mercy."
13259,17336,1,Dan,3043,"&ldquo;Deliver us in accordance with Thy marvelous works, and give glory to Thy name, O Lord!"
13260,17337,1,Dan,3044,"&ldquo;Let all who do harm to Thy servants be put to shame; let them be disgraced and deprived of all power and dominion, and let their strength be broken."
13261,17338,1,Dan,3045,"&ldquo;Let them know that Thou art the Lord, the only God, glorious over the whole world.&rdquo;"
13262,17339,1,Dan,3046,"Now the king&rsquo;s servants who threw them in did not cease feeding the furnace fires with naptha, pitch, tow, and brush."
13263,17340,1,Dan,3047,"And the flame streamed out above the furnace forty-nine cubits,"
13264,17341,1,Dan,3048,and it broke through and burned those of the Chaldeans whom it caught about in the furnace.
13265,17342,1,Dan,3049,"But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the furnace,"
13266,17343,1,Dan,3050,"and made the midst of the furnace like a moist whistling wind, so that the fire did not touch them at all or hurt or trouble them."
13267,17344,1,Dan,3051,"Then the three, as with one mouth, praised and glorified and blessed God in the furnace, saying:"
13268,17345,1,Dan,3052,"&ldquo;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and to be praised and highly exalted for ever; &ldquo;And blessed is Thy glorious, holy name, and to be highly praised and highly exalted for ever;"
13269,17346,1,Dan,3053,"&ldquo;Blessed art Thou in the temple of Thy holy glory, and to be extolled and highly glorified for ever."
13270,17347,1,Dan,3054,"&ldquo;Blessed art Thou, who sittest upon cherubim and lookest upon the deeps, and to be praised and highly exalted for ever."
13271,17348,1,Dan,3055,"&ldquo;Blessed art Thou upon the throne of Thy kingdom, and to be extolled and highly exalted for ever."
13272,17349,1,Dan,3056,"&ldquo;Blessed art Thou in the firmament of heaven, and to be sung and glorified for ever.&rdquo;"
13273,17350,1,Dan,3057,"Bless the Lord, all works of the Lord."
13274,17351,1,Dan,3058,"Bless the Lord, you heavens,"
13275,17352,1,Dan,3059,"Bless the Lord, you angels of the Lord."
13276,17353,1,Dan,3060,"Bless the Lord, all waters above the heaven."
13277,17354,1,Dan,3061,"Bless the Lord, all powers."
13278,1555,1,Exod,1022,"So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, &ldquo;Every son who is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.&rdquo;"
13279,1556,1,Exod,2001,And a man of the house of Levi went and took as wife a daughter of Levi.
13280,1557,1,Exod,2002,"So the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him three months."
13281,1558,1,Exod,2003,"But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of bulrushes for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river&rsquo;s bank."
13282,1559,1,Exod,2004,"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him."
13283,1560,1,Exod,2005,"Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it."
13284,1561,1,Exod,2006,"And when she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, &ldquo;This is one of the Hebrews&rsquo; children.&rdquo;"
13285,1562,1,Exod,2007,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?&rdquo;"
13286,1563,1,Exod,2008,"And Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; So the maiden went and called the child&rsquo;s mother."
13287,1564,1,Exod,2009,"Then Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, &ldquo;Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.&rdquo; So the woman took the child and nursed him."
13288,1565,1,Exod,2010,"And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, and he became her son. So she called his name Moses, saying, &ldquo;Because I drew him out of the water.&rdquo;"
13289,1566,1,Exod,2011,"Now it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren."
13290,1567,1,Exod,2012,"So he looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
13291,1568,1,Exod,2013,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, &ldquo;Why are you striking your companion?&rdquo;"
13292,1569,1,Exod,2014,"Then he said, &ldquo;Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&rdquo; So Moses feared and said, &ldquo;Surely this thing is known!&rdquo;"
13293,1570,1,Exod,2015,"When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well."
13294,1571,1,Exod,2016,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father&rsquo;s flock."
13295,1572,1,Exod,2017,"Then the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
13296,1573,1,Exod,2018,"When they came to Reuel their father, he said, &ldquo;How is it that you have come so soon today?&rdquo;"
13297,1574,1,Exod,2019,"And they said, &ldquo;An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.&rdquo;"
13298,1575,1,Exod,2020,"So he said to his daughters, &ldquo;And where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.&rdquo;"
13299,1576,1,Exod,2021,"Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses."
13300,1577,1,Exod,2022,"And she bore him a son. He called his name Gershom, for he said, &ldquo;I have been a stranger in a foreign land.&rdquo;"
13301,1578,1,Exod,2023,"Now it happened in the process of time that the king of Egypt died. Then the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage."
13302,1579,1,Exod,2024,"So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
13303,1580,1,Exod,2025,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God acknowledged them."
13304,1581,1,Exod,3001,"Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
13305,1582,1,Exod,3002,"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed."
13306,1583,1,Exod,3003,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.&rdquo;"
13307,1584,1,Exod,3004,"So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, &ldquo;Moses, Moses!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;"
13308,1585,1,Exod,3005,"Then He said, &ldquo;Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.&rdquo;"
13309,1586,1,Exod,3006,"Moreover He said, &ldquo;I am the God of your father &ndash; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God."
13310,1587,1,Exod,3007,"And the Lord said: &ldquo;I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows."
13311,1588,1,Exod,3008,"&ldquo;So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites"
13312,1589,1,Exod,3009,"&ldquo;Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."
13313,1590,1,Exod,3010,"&ldquo;Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&rdquo;"
13314,1591,1,Exod,3011,"But Moses said to God, &ldquo;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&rdquo;"
13315,1592,1,Exod,3012,"So He said, &ldquo;I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&rdquo;"
13316,1593,1,Exod,3013,"Then Moses said to God, &ldquo;Indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, &lsquo;The God of your fathers has sent me to you,&rsquo; and they say to me, &lsquo;What is His name?&rsquo; what shall I say to them?&rdquo;"
13317,1594,1,Exod,3014,"And God said to Moses, &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM.&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, &lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
13318,1595,1,Exod,3015,"Moreover God said to Moses, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: &lsquo;The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations.&rsquo;"
13319,1596,1,Exod,3016,"&ldquo;Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, &lsquo;The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, &ldquo;I have surely visited you and seen what is done to you in Egypt;"
13320,1597,1,Exod,3017,"&ldquo;and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
13321,1598,1,Exod,3018,"&ldquo;Then they will heed your voice; and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt; and you shall say to him, &lsquo;The Lord God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now, please, let us go three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness, that we ma"
13322,1599,1,Exod,3019,"&ldquo;But I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not even by a mighty hand."
13323,1600,1,Exod,3020,"&ldquo;So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and after that he will let you go."
13324,1601,1,Exod,3021,"&ldquo;And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be, when you go, that you shall not go empty-handed."
13325,1602,1,Exod,3022,"&ldquo;But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, namely, of her who dwells near her house, articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.&rdquo;"
13326,1603,1,Exod,4001,"Then Moses answered and said, &ldquo;But suppose they will not believe me or listen to my voice; suppose they say, &lsquo;The Lord has not appeared to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
13327,1604,1,Exod,4002,"So the Lord said to him, &ldquo;What is that in your hand?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;A rod.&rdquo;"
13328,1605,1,Exod,4003,"And He said, &ldquo;Cast it on the ground.&rdquo; So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it."
13329,1606,1,Exod,4004,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Reach out your hand and take it by the tail&rdquo; (and he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand),"
13330,1607,1,Exod,4005,"&ldquo;that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.&rdquo;"
13331,1608,1,Exod,4006,"Furthermore the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Now put your hand in your bosom.&rdquo; And he put his hand in his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, like snow."
13332,1609,1,Exod,4007,"And He said, &ldquo;Put your hand in your bosom again.&rdquo; So he put his hand in his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his other flesh."
13333,1610,1,Exod,4008,"&ldquo;Then it will be, if they do not believe you, nor heed the message of the first sign, that they may believe the message of the latter sign."
13334,1611,1,Exod,4009,"&ldquo;And it shall be, if they do not believe even these two signs, or listen to your voice, that you shall take water from the river and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry land.&rdquo;"
13335,1612,1,Exod,4010,"Then Moses said to the Lord, &ldquo;O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.&rdquo;"
13336,1613,1,Exod,4011,"So the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Who has made man&rsquo;s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the Lord?"
13337,1614,1,Exod,4012,"&ldquo;Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.&rdquo;"
13338,1615,1,Exod,4013,"But he said, &ldquo;O my Lord, please send by the hand of whomever else You may send.&rdquo;"
13339,1616,1,Exod,4014,"So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and He said: &ldquo;Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And look, he is also coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart."
13340,1617,1,Exod,4015,"&ldquo;Now you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do."
13341,1618,1,Exod,4016,"&ldquo;So he shall be your spokesman to the people. And he himself shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God."
13342,1619,1,Exod,4017,"&ldquo;And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.&rdquo;"
13343,1620,1,Exod,4018,"So Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, &ldquo;Please let me go and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.&rdquo; And Jethro said to Moses, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo;"
13344,1621,1,Exod,4019,"Now the Lord said to Moses in Midian, &ldquo;Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.&rdquo;"
13345,1622,1,Exod,4020,"Then Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
13346,1623,1,Exod,4021,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go."
13347,1624,1,Exod,4022,"&ldquo;Then you shall say to Pharaoh, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord: &ldquo;Israel is My son, My firstborn."
13348,1625,1,Exod,4023,"&ldquo;So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, indeed I will kill your son, your firstborn.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
13349,1626,1,Exod,4024,"And it came to pass on the way, at the encampment, that the Lord met him and sought to kill him."
13350,1627,1,Exod,4025,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at Moses&rsquo; feet, and said, &ldquo;Surely you are a husband of blood to me!&rdquo;"
13351,1628,1,Exod,4026,"So He let him go. Then she said, &ldquo;You are a husband of blood!&rdquo; &ndash; because of the circumcision."
13352,1629,1,Exod,4027,"And the Lord said to Aaron, &ldquo;Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.&rdquo; So he went and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him."
13353,1630,1,Exod,4028,"So Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him."
13354,1631,1,Exod,4029,Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
13355,1632,1,Exod,4030,And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses. Then he did the signs in the sight of the people.
13356,1633,1,Exod,4031,"So the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and that He had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped."
13357,1634,1,Exod,5001,"Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord God of Israel: &lsquo;Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
13358,1635,1,Exod,5002,"And Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, nor will I let Israel go.&rdquo;"
13359,1636,1,Exod,5003,"So they said, &ldquo;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go three days&rsquo; journey into the desert and sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&rdquo;"
13360,1637,1,Exod,5004,"Then the king of Egypt said to them, &ldquo;Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people from their work? Get back to your labor.&rdquo;"
13361,1638,1,Exod,5005,"And Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Look, the people of the land are many now, and you make them rest from their labor!&rdquo;"
13362,1639,1,Exod,5006,"So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,"
13363,1640,1,Exod,5007,"&ldquo;You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves."
13364,1641,1,Exod,5008,"&ldquo;And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before. You shall not reduce it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, &lsquo;Let us go and sacrifice to our God.&rsquo;"
13365,9670,1,4Kg,9020,"So the watchman reported, saying, &ldquo;He went up to them and is not coming back; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously!&rdquo; "

13373,8980,1,3Kg,8053,"For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, as You spoke by Your servant Moses, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God. "
13374,8981,1,3Kg,8054,"And so it was, when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the Lord, that he arose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. "
13375,8982,1,3Kg,8055,"Then he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying: "
13376,8983,1,3Kg,8056,"Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised. There has not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised through His servant Moses. "

13382,8989,1,3Kg,8062,Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord. 
13383,8990,1,3Kg,8063,"And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the Lord, twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. "
13384,8991,1,3Kg,8064,"On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

13385,8992,1,3Kg,8065,"At that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven more days &ndash; fourteen days. "

13400,9007,1,3Kg,9014,Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.

13434,9041,1,3Kg,10020,"Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom. "
13435,9042,1,3Kg,10021,"All King Solomon&rsquo;s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. "
13436,9043,1,3Kg,10022,"For the king had merchant ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys."
13437,9044,1,3Kg,10023,So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
13438,9045,1,3Kg,10024,"Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. "
13439,9046,1,3Kg,10025,"Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year. "
13440,9047,1,3Kg,10026,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. "
13441,9048,1,3Kg,10027,"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland. "
13442,9049,1,3Kg,10028,"Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king&rsquo;s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price. "
13443,9050,1,3Kg,10029,"Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria. "
13444,9051,1,3Kg,11001,"But King Solomon loved many foreign women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh: women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites &ndash; "

13446,9468,1,4Kg,2023,"Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, &ldquo;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&rdquo; "
13447,9469,1,4Kg,2024,"So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths. "

13449,9471,1,4Kg,3001,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. "

13452,9474,1,4Kg,3004,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. "

13454,9476,1,4Kg,3006,So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. 
13455,9477,1,4Kg,3007,"Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, &ldquo;The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&rdquo; "

13458,9480,1,4Kg,3010,"And the king of Israel said, &ldquo;Alas! For the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.&rdquo; "
13459,9481,1,4Kg,3011,"But Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Is there no prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?&rdquo; So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, &ldquo;Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.&rdquo; "
13460,9482,1,4Kg,3012,"And Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;The word of the Lord is with him.&rdquo; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. "
13461,9483,1,4Kg,3013,"Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;What have I to do with you?

13466,9488,1,4Kg,3018,"And this is a simple matter in the sight of the Lord; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. "
13467,9489,1,4Kg,3019,"Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.&rdquo; "
13468,9490,1,4Kg,3020,"Now it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that suddenly water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water. "
13469,9491,1,4Kg,3021,"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they stood at the border. "
13470,9492,1,4Kg,3022,"Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood. "
13471,9493,1,4Kg,3023,"And they said, &ldquo;This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!&rdquo; "
13472,9494,1,4Kg,3024,"So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered their land, killing the Moabites. "
13473,9495,1,4Kg,3025,"Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth intact. However the slingers surrounded and attacked it. "
13474,9496,1,4Kg,3026,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not. "
13475,9497,1,4Kg,3027,"Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall; and there was great indignation against Israel. So they departed from him and returned to their own land. "
13476,9498,1,4Kg,4001,"A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, &ldquo;Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the Lord. And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.&rdquo; "

13481,9503,1,4Kg,4006,"Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, &ldquo;Bring me another vessel.&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;There is not another vessel.&rdquo; So the oil ceased. "
13482,9504,1,4Kg,4007,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, &ldquo;Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.&rdquo; "
13483,9505,1,4Kg,4008,"Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food. "
13484,9506,1,4Kg,4009,"And she said to her husband, &ldquo;Look now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly. "

13495,9517,1,4Kg,4020,"When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. "
13496,9518,1,4Kg,4021,"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out. "
13497,9519,1,4Kg,4022,"Then she called to her husband, and said, &ldquo;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.&rdquo; "

13499,9521,1,4Kg,4024,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, &ldquo;Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.&rdquo; "
13500,9522,1,4Kg,4025,"And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, &ldquo;Look, the Shunammite woman!. "
13501,9523,1,4Kg,4026,"Please run now to meet her, and say to her, &lsquo;Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?&rsquo; &ldquo; And she answered, &ldquo;It is well.&rdquo; "
13502,9524,1,4Kg,4027,"Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, &ldquo;Let her alone; for her soul is in deep distress, and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told me.&rdquo; "
13503,9525,1,4Kg,4028,"So she said, &ldquo;Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, &lsquo;Do not deceive me&rsquo;?&rdquo; "
13504,9526,1,4Kg,4029,"Then he said to Gehazi, &ldquo;Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.&rdquo; "
13505,9527,1,4Kg,4030,"And the mother of the child said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So he arose and followed her. "
13506,9528,1,4Kg,4031,"Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, &ldquo;The child has not awakened.&rdquo; "

13508,9530,1,4Kg,4033,"He went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the Lord. "
13509,9531,1,4Kg,4034,"And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm. "

13736,11482,1,2Chr,22007,"His going to Joram was God&rsquo;s occasion for Ahaziah&rsquo;s downfall; for when he arrived, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. "

13938,1132,1,Gen,38012,"Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah&rsquo;s wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."

13942,1136,1,Gen,38016,"Then he turned to her by the way, and said, &ldquo;Please let me come in to you&rdquo;; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, &ldquo;What will you give me, that you may come in to me?&rdquo;"
13943,1137,1,Gen,38017,"And he said, &ldquo;I will send a young goat from the flock.&rdquo; So she said, &ldquo;Will you give me a pledge till you send it?&rdquo;"

13960,1154,1,Gen,39004,"So Joseph found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer of his house, and all that he had he put under his authority."
13961,1155,1,Gen,39005,"So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field."
13962,1156,1,Gen,39006,"Thus he left all that he had in Joseph&rsquo;s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance."
13963,1157,1,Gen,39007,"And it came to pass after these things that his master&rsquo;s wife cast longing eyes on Joseph, and she said, &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;"

13967,1161,1,Gen,39011,"But it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house was inside,"
13968,1162,1,Gen,39012,"that she caught him by his garment, saying, &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo; But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside."
13969,1163,1,Gen,39013,"And so it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside,"
13970,1164,1,Gen,39014,"that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice."

13976,1170,1,Gen,39020,"Then Joseph&rsquo;s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king&rsquo;s prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison."

13982,1176,1,Gen,40003,"So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Joseph was confined."
13983,1177,1,Gen,40004,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a while."
13984,1178,1,Gen,40005,"Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream, both of them, each man&rsquo;s dream in one night and each man&rsquo;s dream with its own interpretation."
13985,1179,1,Gen,40006,"And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and saw that they were sad."
13986,1180,1,Gen,40007,"So he asked Pharaoh&rsquo;s officers who were with him in the custody of his lord&rsquo;s house, saying, &ldquo;Why do you look so sad today?&rdquo;"

13992,1186,1,Gen,40013,"&ldquo;Now within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you will put Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup in his hand according to the former manner, when you were his butler."
13993,1187,1,Gen,40014,"&ldquo;But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house."
13994,1188,1,Gen,40015,"&ldquo;For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon.&rdquo;"
13995,1189,1,Gen,40016,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, &ldquo;I also was in my dream, and there were three white baskets on my head."

14000,1194,1,Gen,40021,"Then he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand."
14001,1195,1,Gen,40022,"But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them."
14002,1196,1,Gen,40023,"Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
14003,1197,1,Gen,41001,"Then it came to pass, at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh had a dream; and behold, he stood by the river."
14004,1198,1,Gen,41002,"Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow."

14006,1200,1,Gen,41004,And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.

14009,1203,1,Gen,41007,"And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, it was a dream."
14010,1204,1,Gen,41008,"Now it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh."
14011,1205,1,Gen,41009,"Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: &ldquo;I remember my faults this day."

14377,5002,1,Deut,3018,"Then I commanded you at that time, saying: &lsquo;The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. All you men of valor shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel. "
14378,5003,1,Deut,3019,"But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall stay in your cities which I have given you, "

14380,5005,1,Deut,3021,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, &lsquo;Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms through which you pass. "
14381,5006,1,Deut,3022,"You must not fear them, for the Lord your God Himself fights for you.&rsquo; "
14382,5007,1,Deut,3023,"Then I pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying: "
14383,5008,1,Deut,3024,"&rsquo;O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do anything like Your works and Your mighty deeds? "

14385,5010,1,Deut,3026,"But the Lord was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. So the Lord said to me: &lsquo;Enough of that! Speak no more to Me of this matter. "
14386,5011,1,Deut,3027,"Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan. "
14387,5012,1,Deut,3028,"But command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see.&rsquo; "
14388,5013,1,Deut,3029,So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor. 
14389,5014,1,Deut,4001,"Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I teach you to observe, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers is giving you. "
14390,5015,1,Deut,4002,"You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. "
14391,5016,1,Deut,4003,"Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor; for the Lord your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor. "
14392,5017,1,Deut,4004,"But you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive today, every one of you. "
14393,5018,1,Deut,4005,"Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should act according to them in the land which you go to possess. "
14394,5019,1,Deut,4006,"Therefore be careful to observe them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, &lsquo;Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.&rsquo; "
14395,5020,1,Deut,4007,"For what great nation is there that has God so near to it, as the Lord our God is to us, for whatever reason we may call upon Him? "
14396,5021,1,Deut,4008,And what great nation is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this law which I set before you this day? 
14397,5022,1,Deut,4009,"Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. And teach them to your children and your grandchildren, "
14398,5023,1,Deut,4010,"especially concerning the day you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.&rsquo; "
14399,5024,1,Deut,4011,"Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. "
14400,5025,1,Deut,4012,"And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice. "
14401,5026,1,Deut,4013,"So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. "
14402,5027,1,Deut,4014,"And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might observe them in the land which you cross over to possess. "
14403,5145,1,Deut,7025,"You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to the Lord your God. "
14404,5146,1,Deut,7026,"Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be doomed to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is an accursed thing. "

14406,5148,1,Deut,8002,"And you shall remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. "
14407,5149,1,Deut,8003,"So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord. "
14408,5150,1,Deut,8004,"Your garments did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years. "
14409,5151,1,Deut,8005,"You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so the Lord your God chastens you. "
14410,5152,1,Deut,8006,"Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him. "
14411,5153,1,Deut,8007,"For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, that flow out of valleys and hills; "

14423,5165,1,Deut,8019,"Then it shall be, if you by any means forget the Lord your God, and follow other gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish. "
14424,5166,1,Deut,8020,"As the nations which the Lord destroys before you, so you shall perish, because you would not be obedient to the voice of the Lord your God. "
14425,5167,1,Deut,9001,"Hear, O Israel: You are to cross over the Jordan today, and go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, "
14426,5168,1,Deut,9002,"a people great and tall, the descendants of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you heard it said, &lsquo;Who can stand before the descendants of Anak?&rsquo; "
14427,5169,1,Deut,9003,"Therefore understand today that the Lord your God is He who goes over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; so you shall drive them out and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has said to you. "
14428,5170,1,Deut,9004,"Do not think in your heart, after the Lord your God has cast them out before you, saying, &lsquo;Because of my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to possess this land&rsquo;; but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out from before you.

14429,5171,1,Deut,9005,"It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you go in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord your God drives them out from before you, and that He may fulfill the word which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. "
14430,5172,1,Deut,9006,"Therefore understand that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people. "
14431,5173,1,Deut,9007,"Remember. Do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord. "
14432,5174,1,Deut,9008,"Also in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry enough with you to have destroyed you. "
14433,5175,1,Deut,9009,"When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. "
14434,5176,1,Deut,9010,"Then the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. "
14435,5177,1,Deut,9011,"And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. "
14436,5178,1,Deut,9012,"Then the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molded image.&rsquo; "
14437,5179,1,Deut,9013,"Furthermore the Lord spoke to me, saying, &lsquo;I have seen this people, and indeed they are a stiff-necked people. "
14438,5180,1,Deut,9014,"Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.&rsquo; "
14439,5181,1,Deut,9015,"So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. "
14440,5182,1,Deut,9016,"And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God &ndash; had made for yourselves a molded calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which the Lord had commanded you. "
14441,5183,1,Deut,9017,Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes. 
14442,5184,1,Deut,9018,"And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. "
14443,5185,1,Deut,9019,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord was angry with you, to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me at that time also. "
14444,5186,1,Deut,9020,"And the Lord was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him; so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. "
14445,5187,1,Deut,9021,"Then I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it and ground it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain. "
14446,5188,1,Deut,9022,Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath. 
14447,5189,1,Deut,9023,"Likewise, when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, &lsquo;Go up and possess the land which I have given you,&rsquo; then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice. "
14448,5190,1,Deut,9024,You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you. 
14449,5191,1,Deut,9025,"Thus I prostrated myself before the Lord; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because the Lord had said He would destroy you. "
14450,5192,1,Deut,9026,"Therefore I prayed to the Lord, and said: &lsquo;O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. "
14451,5193,1,Deut,9027,"Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin, "
14452,5194,1,Deut,9028,"lest the land from which You brought us should say, Because the Lord was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness. "
14453,5195,1,Deut,9029,"Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm.&rsquo; "
14454,5196,1,Deut,10001,"At that time the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of wood. "
14455,5197,1,Deut,10002,"And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you shall put them in the ark.&rsquo; "
14456,5198,1,Deut,10003,"So I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. "
14457,5199,1,Deut,10004,"And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments, which the Lord had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me. "
14458,5200,1,Deut,10005,"Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, just as the Lord commanded me.&rdquo; "
14459,5201,1,Deut,10006,"(Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his stead. "
14460,5202,1,Deut,10007,"From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of water. "
14461,5203,1,Deut,10008,"At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless in His name, to this day. "
14462,5204,1,Deut,10009,"Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, just as the Lord your God promised him.) "
14463,5205,1,Deut,10010,"As at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; the Lord also heard me at that time, and the Lord chose not to destroy you. "
14464,5206,1,Deut,10011,"Then the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Arise, begin your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.&rsquo; "
14465,5207,1,Deut,10012,"And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, "
14466,5208,1,Deut,10013,and to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command you today for your good?

14470,5212,1,Deut,10017,"For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe. "
14471,5213,1,Deut,10018,"He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. "

14531,5895,1,Josh,3016,"that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. So the waters that went down into the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, failed, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho. "
14532,5896,1,Josh,3017,"Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan. "
14533,5897,1,Josh,4001,"And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying: "
14534,5898,1,Josh,4002,"Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe, "
14535,5899,1,Josh,4003,"and command them, saying, &lsquo;Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests&rsquo; feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.&rsquo; "
14536,5900,1,Josh,4004,"Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe; "
14537,5901,1,Josh,4005,"and Joshua said to them: &ldquo;Cross over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, "
14538,5902,1,Josh,4006,"that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, &lsquo;What do these stones mean to you?&rsquo; "
14539,5903,1,Josh,4007,"Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.&rdquo; "
14540,5904,1,Josh,4008,"And the children of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. "
14541,5905,1,Josh,4009,"Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day. "
14542,5906,1,Josh,4010,"So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over. "
14543,5907,1,Josh,4011,"Then it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people. "
14544,5908,1,Josh,4012,"And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them. "
14545,5909,1,Josh,4013,"About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before the Lord for battle, to the plains of Jericho. "
14546,5910,1,Josh,4014,"On that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life. "
14547,5911,1,Josh,4015,"Then the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, "
14548,5912,1,Josh,4016,Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan. 
14549,5913,1,Josh,4017,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, &ldquo;Come up from the Jordan.&rdquo; "
14550,5914,1,Josh,4018,"And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests&rsquo; feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before. "
14551,5915,1,Josh,4019,"Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. "
14552,5916,1,Josh,4020,"And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. "
14553,5917,1,Josh,4021,"Then he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: &ldquo;When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, &lsquo;What are these stones?&rsquo; "
14554,5918,1,Josh,4022,"then you shall let your children know, saying, &lsquo;Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land&rsquo;; "
14555,5919,1,Josh,4023,"for the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over, "
14556,5920,1,Josh,4024,"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty, that you may fear the Lord your God forever.&rdquo; "
14557,5921,1,Josh,5001,"So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we* had crossed over, that their heart melted; and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel. "
14558,5922,1,Josh,5002,"At that time the Lord said to Joshua, &ldquo;Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.&rdquo; "
14559,5923,1,Josh,5003,"So Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."
14560,5924,1,Josh,5004,"And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt. "
14561,5925,1,Josh,5005,"For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised. "
14562,5926,1,Josh,5006,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people who were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of the Lord &ndash; to whom the Lord swore that He would not show them the land which the Lord had sworn to their fathers that He would give us, &ldquo;a land flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo;"
14563,5927,1,Josh,5007,"Then Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way. "
14564,5928,1,Josh,5008,"So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed. "
14565,5929,1,Josh,5009,"Then the Lord said to Joshua, &ldquo;This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&rdquo; Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day. "
14566,5930,1,Josh,5010,"Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho. "
14567,5931,1,Josh,5011,"And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and parched grain, on the very same day. "
14568,5932,1,Josh,5012,"Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year. "
14569,5933,1,Josh,5013,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, &ldquo;Are You for us or for our adversaries?&rdquo; "
14570,5934,1,Josh,5014,"So He said, &ldquo;No, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.&rdquo; And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, &ldquo;What does my Lord say to His servant?&rdquo; "
14571,5935,1,Josh,5015,"Then the Commander of the Lord&rsquo;s army said to Joshua, &ldquo;Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.&rdquo; And Joshua did so. "
14572,5936,1,Josh,6001,"Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel; none went out, and none came in. "
14573,5937,1,Josh,6002,"And the Lord said to Joshua: &ldquo;See! I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor. "
14574,5938,1,Josh,6003,"You shall march around the city, all you men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days. "
14575,5939,1,Josh,6004,"And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the ark. But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. "
14576,5940,1,Josh,6005,"It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram&rsquo;s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.&rdquo; "
14577,5941,1,Josh,6006,"Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, &ldquo;Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the ark of the Lord.&rdquo; "
14578,5942,1,Josh,6007,"And he said to the people, &ldquo;Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the Lord.&rdquo; "
14579,5943,1,Josh,6008,"So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the Lord advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. "
14580,5944,1,Josh,6009,"The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets. "
14581,5945,1,Josh,6010,"Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, &ldquo;You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, &lsquo;Shout!&rsquo; Then you shall shout.&rdquo; "
14582,5946,1,Josh,6011,"So he had the ark of the Lord circle the city, going around it once. Then they came into the camp and lodged in the camp. "
14583,5947,1,Josh,6012,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. "
14584,5948,1,Josh,6013,"Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets. And the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets. "
14585,5949,1,Josh,6014,And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. So they did six days. 
14586,5950,1,Josh,6015,"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times. "
14587,5951,1,Josh,6016,"And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: &ldquo;Shout, for the Lord has given you the city! "
14588,5952,1,Josh,6017,"Now the city shall be doomed by the Lord to destruction, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. "
14589,5953,1,Josh,6018,"And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. "
14590,5954,1,Josh,6019,"But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the Lord; they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.&rdquo; "
14591,5955,1,Josh,6020,"So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. "
14592,5956,1,Josh,6021,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword. "
14593,5957,1,Josh,6022,"But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country, &ldquo;Go into the harlot&rsquo;s house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.&rdquo; "
14594,7281,1,1Kg,4005,"And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook. "
14595,7282,1,1Kg,4006,"Now when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, &ldquo;What does the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?&rdquo; Then they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp. "
14596,7283,1,1Kg,4007,"So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, &ldquo;God has come into the camp!&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Woe to us! For such a thing has never happened before. "
14597,7284,1,1Kg,4008,Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. 
14598,7285,1,1Kg,4009,"Be strong and conduct yourselves like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight!&rdquo; "
14599,7286,1,1Kg,4010,"So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. "
14600,7287,1,1Kg,4011,"Also the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died. "
14601,7288,1,1Kg,4012,"Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. "
14602,7289,1,1Kg,4013,"Now when he came, there was Eli, sitting on a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told it, all the city cried out. "
14603,7290,1,1Kg,4014,"When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, &ldquo;What does the sound of this tumult mean?&rdquo; And the man came quickly and told Eli. "
14604,7291,1,1Kg,4015,"Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were so dim that he could not see. "
14605,7292,1,1Kg,4016,"Then the man said to Eli, &ldquo;I am he who came from the battle. And I fled today from the battle line.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;What happened, my son?&rdquo; "
14606,7293,1,1Kg,4017,"So the messenger answered and said, &ldquo;Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the ark of God has been captured.&rdquo; "
14607,7294,1,1Kg,4018,"Then it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. "
14608,7295,1,1Kg,4019,"Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas&rsquo; wife, was with child, due to be delivered; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her labor pains came upon her. "
14609,7296,1,1Kg,4020,"And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, &ldquo;Do not fear, for you have borne a son.&rdquo; But she did not answer, nor did she regard it. "
14610,7297,1,1Kg,4021,"Then she named the child Ichabod, saying, &ldquo;The glory has departed from Israel!&rdquo; because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband. "
14611,7298,1,1Kg,4022,"And she said, &ldquo;The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.&rdquo; "
14612,7299,1,1Kg,5001,Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
14613,7300,1,1Kg,5002,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the temple of Dagon and set it by Dagon. "
14614,7301,1,1Kg,5003,"And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. So they took Dagon and set it in its place again. "
14615,7372,1,1Kg,9002,And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people. 
14616,7373,1,1Kg,9003,"Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul&rsquo;s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, &ldquo;Please, take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.&rdquo; "
14617,7374,1,1Kg,9004,"So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them. "
14618,7375,1,1Kg,9005,"When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, &ldquo;Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring about the donkeys and become worried about us.&rdquo; "
14619,7376,1,1Kg,9006,"And he said to him, &ldquo;Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.&rdquo; "
14620,7377,1,1Kg,9007,"Then Saul said to his servant, &ldquo;But look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?&rdquo; "
14621,7378,1,1Kg,9008,"And the servant answered Saul again and said, &ldquo;Look, I have here at hand one fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.&rdquo; "
14622,7379,1,1Kg,9009,"(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he spoke thus: &ldquo;Come, let us go to the seer&rdquo;; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.) "
14623,7380,1,1Kg,9010,"Then Saul said to his servant, &ldquo;Well said; come, let us go.&rdquo; So they went to the city where the man of God was. "
14624,7381,1,1Kg,9011,"As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, &ldquo;Is the seer here?&rdquo; "
14625,7382,1,1Kg,9012,"And they answered them and said, &ldquo;Yes, there he is, just ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he came to this city, because there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place. "
14626,7383,1,1Kg,9013,"As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for about this time you will find him.&rdquo; "
14627,7384,1,1Kg,9014,"So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, there was Samuel, coming out toward them on his way up to the high place. "
14628,7385,1,1Kg,9015,"Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came, saying, "
14629,7386,1,1Kg,9016,"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel, that he may save My people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to me. "
14630,7387,1,1Kg,9017,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;There he is, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.&rdquo; "
14631,7388,1,1Kg,9018,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, &ldquo;Please tell me, where is the seer&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; "
14632,7389,1,1Kg,9019,"And Samuel answered Saul and said, &ldquo;I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart. "
14633,7390,1,1Kg,9020,"But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; "
14634,7391,1,1Kg,9021,"And Saul answered and said, &ldquo;Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak like this to me?&rdquo; "
14635,7392,1,1Kg,9022,"Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited; there were about thirty persons. "
14636,7393,1,1Kg,9023,"And Samuel said to the cook, &ldquo;Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, &lsquo;Set it apart.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
14637,7394,1,1Kg,9024,"So the cook took up the thigh with its upper part and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, &ldquo;Here it is, what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat; for until this time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people.&rdquo; So Saul ate with Samuel that day. "
14638,7395,1,1Kg,9025,"When they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the top of the house."
14639,7396,1,1Kg,9026,"They arose early; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house, saying, &ldquo;Get up, that I may send you on your way.&rdquo; And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel. "
14640,7397,1,1Kg,9027,"As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.&rdquo; And he went on. &ldquo;But you stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the word of God.&rdquo; "
14641,7398,1,1Kg,10001,"Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said: &ldquo;Is it not because the Lord has anointed you commander over His inheritance?* "
14642,7399,1,1Kg,10002,"When you have departed from me today, you will find two men by Rachel&rsquo;s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, &lsquo;The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about you, saying, &ldquo;What shall I do about my son?&rdquo; &lsquo; "
14643,7400,1,1Kg,10003,"Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor. There three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. "
14644,7401,1,1Kg,10004,"And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hands. "
14645,7402,1,1Kg,10005,"After that you shall come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is. And it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a stringed instrument, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying. "
14646,7403,1,1Kg,10006,"Then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man. "
14647,7404,1,1Kg,10007,"And let it be, when these signs come to you, that you do as the occasion demands; for God is with you. "
14648,7405,1,1Kg,10008,"You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and make sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, till I come to you and show you what you should do.&rdquo; "
14649,7406,1,1Kg,10009,"So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. "
14650,7407,1,1Kg,10010,"When they came there to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. "

15059,7641,1,1Kg,17044,"And the Philistine said to David, &ldquo;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!&rdquo; "
15060,7642,1,1Kg,17045,"Then David said to the Philistine, &ldquo;You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. "
15061,7643,1,1Kg,17046,"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. "
15062,7644,1,1Kg,17047,"Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord&rsquo;s, and He will give you into our hands.&rdquo; "
15063,7645,1,1Kg,17048,"So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hastened and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. "
15064,7646,1,1Kg,17049,"Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. "
15065,7647,1,1Kg,17050,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David. "
15066,7648,1,1Kg,17051,"Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. "
15067,7649,1,1Kg,17052,"Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron. "
15068,7650,1,1Kg,17053,"Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents. "
15069,7651,1,1Kg,17054,"And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent. "
15070,7652,1,1Kg,17055,"When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, &ldquo;Abner, whose son is this youth?&rdquo; And Abner said, &ldquo;As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.&rdquo; "
15071,7653,1,1Kg,17056,"So the king said, &ldquo;Inquire whose son this young man is.&rdquo; "
15072,7654,1,1Kg,17057,"Then, as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. "
15073,7655,1,1Kg,17058,"And Saul said to him, &ldquo;Whose son are you, young man?&rdquo; So David answered, &ldquo;I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&rdquo; "
15074,7656,1,1Kg,18001,"Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. "
15075,7657,1,1Kg,18002,"Saul took him that day, and would not let him go home to his father&rsquo;s house anymore. "
15076,7658,1,1Kg,18003,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. "
15077,7659,1,1Kg,18004,"And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt. "
15078,7660,1,1Kg,18005,"So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul&rsquo;s servants. "
15079,7661,1,1Kg,18006,"Now it had happened as they were coming home, when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women had come out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments. "
15080,7662,1,1Kg,18007,"So the women sang as they danced, and said: &ldquo;Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.&rdquo; "
15081,7663,1,1Kg,18008,"Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, &ldquo;They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?&rdquo; "
15082,7664,1,1Kg,18009,So Saul eyed David from that day forward. 
15083,7665,1,1Kg,18010,"And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul&rsquo;s hand. "
15084,7666,1,1Kg,18011,"And Saul cast the spear, for he said, &ldquo;I will pin David to the wall!&rdquo; But David escaped his presence twice. "
15085,7667,1,1Kg,18012,"Now Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, but had departed from Saul. "
15086,7668,1,1Kg,18013,"Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. "
15087,7669,1,1Kg,18014,"And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him. "
15088,7670,1,1Kg,18015,"Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him. "
15089,7671,1,1Kg,18016,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them. "
15090,7672,1,1Kg,18017,"Then Saul said to David, &ldquo;Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the Lord&rsquo;s battles.&rdquo; For Saul thought, &ldquo;Let my hand not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.&rdquo; "
15091,7673,1,1Kg,18018,"So David said to Saul, &ldquo;Who am I, and what is my life or my father&rsquo;s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?&rdquo; "
15092,7674,1,1Kg,18019,"But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife. "
15093,7675,1,1Kg,18020,"Now Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. "
15094,7676,1,1Kg,18021,"So Saul said, &ldquo;I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&rdquo; Therefore Saul said to David a second time, &ldquo;You shall be my son-in-law today.&rdquo; "
15095,7677,1,1Kg,18022,"And Saul commanded his servants, &ldquo;Communicate with David secretly, and say, &lsquo;Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king&rsquo;s son-in-law.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
15096,7678,1,1Kg,18023,"So Saul&rsquo;s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, &ldquo;Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king&rsquo;s son-in-law, seeing I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?&rdquo; "
15097,7679,1,1Kg,18024,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, &ldquo;In this manner David spoke.&rdquo; "
15098,7680,1,1Kg,18025,"Then Saul said, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to David: &lsquo;The king does not desire any dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king&rsquo;s enemies.&rsquo; &ldquo; But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. "
15099,7681,1,1Kg,18026,"So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king&rsquo;s son-in-law. Now the days had not expired; "
15100,7682,1,1Kg,18027,"therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king&rsquo;s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife. "
15101,7683,1,1Kg,18028,"Thus Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David, and that Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, loved him; "
15102,7684,1,1Kg,18029,"and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David&rsquo;s enemy continually. "
15103,7685,1,1Kg,18030,"Then the princes of the Philistines went out to war. And so it was, whenever they went out, that David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed. "
15104,7686,1,1Kg,19001,"Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David; but Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, delighted greatly in David. "
15105,7687,1,1Kg,19002,"So Jonathan told David, saying, &ldquo;My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret place and hide. "
15106,7688,1,1Kg,19003,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you. Then what I observe, I will tell you.&rdquo; "
15107,7689,1,1Kg,19004,"Thus Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, &ldquo;Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you. "
15108,7690,1,1Kg,19005,"For he took his life in his hands and killed the Philistine, and the Lord brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?&rdquo; "
15109,7691,1,1Kg,19006,"So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, he shall not be killed.&rdquo; "
15110,7692,1,1Kg,19007,"Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past. "
15111,7693,1,1Kg,19008,"And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him. "
15112,7694,1,1Kg,19009,Now the distressing spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing music with his hand. 
15113,7695,1,1Kg,19010,"Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul&rsquo;s presence; and he drove the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night. "
15114,7696,1,1Kg,19011,"Saul also sent messengers to David&rsquo;s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David&rsquo;s wife, told him, saying, &ldquo;If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.&rdquo; "
15115,11982,1,Ezra,5017,"Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king&rsquo;s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this matter.

15116,8260,1,2Kg,11023,"And the messenger said to David, &ldquo;Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate. "
15117,8261,1,2Kg,11024,"The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the king&rsquo;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&rdquo; "
15118,8262,1,2Kg,11025,"Then David said to the messenger, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to Joab: &lsquo;Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.&rsquo; So encourage him.&rdquo; "
15119,8263,1,2Kg,11026,"When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. "
15120,8264,1,2Kg,11027,"And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord. "
15121,8265,1,2Kg,12001,"Then the Lord sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: &ldquo;There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor. "
15122,8266,1,2Kg,12002,The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds. 
15123,8267,1,2Kg,12003,"But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him. "
15124,8268,1,2Kg,12004,"And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man&rsquo;s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.&rdquo; "
15125,8269,1,2Kg,12005,"So David&rsquo;s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, the man who has done this shall surely die! "
15126,8270,1,2Kg,12006,"And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.&rdquo; "
15127,8271,1,2Kg,12007,"Then Nathan said to David, &ldquo;You are the man! Thus says the Lord God of Israel: &lsquo;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. "
15128,8272,1,2Kg,12008,"I gave you your master&rsquo;s house and your master&rsquo;s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you much more! "
15129,8273,1,2Kg,12009,"Why have you despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon. "
15130,8274,1,2Kg,12010,"Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&rsquo; "
15131,8275,1,2Kg,12011,"Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. "
15132,8276,1,2Kg,12012,"For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
15133,8277,1,2Kg,12013,"So David said to Nathan, &ldquo;I have sinned against the Lord.&rdquo; And Nathan said to David, &ldquo;The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. "
15134,8278,1,2Kg,12014,"However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.&rdquo; "
15135,8279,1,2Kg,12015,"Then Nathan departed to his house.And the Lord struck the child that Uriah&rsquo;s wife bore to David, and it became ill. "
15136,8280,1,2Kg,12016,"David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. "
15137,8281,1,2Kg,12017,"So the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them. "
15138,8282,1,2Kg,12018,"Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, &ldquo;Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!&rdquo; "
15139,8283,1,2Kg,12019,"When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, &ldquo;Is the child dead?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo; "
15140,8284,1,2Kg,12020,"So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate. "
15141,8285,1,2Kg,12021,"Then his servants said to him, &ldquo;What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.&rdquo; "
15142,8286,1,2Kg,12022,"And he said, &ldquo;While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, &lsquo;Who can tell whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?&rsquo; "
15143,8287,1,2Kg,12023,"But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.&rdquo; "
15144,8288,1,2Kg,12024,"Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now the Lord loved him, "
15145,8289,1,2Kg,12025,"and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord. "
15146,8290,1,2Kg,12026,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the people of Ammon, and took the royal city. "
15147,8291,1,2Kg,12027,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, &ldquo;I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city&rsquo;s water supply. "

15149,8293,1,2Kg,12029,"So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it. "
15150,8294,1,2Kg,12030,"Then he took their king&rsquo;s crown from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was set on David&rsquo;s head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance. "
15151,8295,1,2Kg,12031,"And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over to the brick works. So he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. "
15152,8296,1,2Kg,13001,"After this Absalom the son of David had a lovely sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. "

15157,8301,1,2Kg,13006,"Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &ldquo;Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&rdquo; "
15158,8302,1,2Kg,13007,"And David sent home to Tamar, saying, &ldquo;Now go to your brother Amnon&rsquo;s house, and prepare food for him.&rdquo; "
15159,8303,1,2Kg,13008,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&rsquo;s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. "
15160,8304,1,2Kg,13009,"And she took the pan and placed them out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, &ldquo;Have everyone go out from me.&rdquo; And they all went out from him. "
15161,8305,1,2Kg,13010,"Then Amnon said to Tamar, &ldquo;Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.&rdquo; And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom. "
15162,8306,1,2Kg,13011,"Now when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &ldquo;Come, lie with me, my sister.&rdquo; "

15165,8309,1,2Kg,13014,"However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her. "
15166,8310,1,2Kg,13015,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, &ldquo;Arise, be gone!&rdquo; "
15167,8311,1,2Kg,13016,"So she said to him, &ldquo;No, indeed! This evil of sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me.&rdquo; But he would not listen to her. "
15168,8312,1,2Kg,13017,"Then he called his servant who attended him, and said, &ldquo;Here! Put this woman out, away from me, and bolt the door behind her.&rdquo; "
15169,8313,1,2Kg,13018,"Now she had on a robe of many colors, for the king&rsquo;s virgin daughters wore such apparel. And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her. "

15392,453,1,Gen,18028,"&ldquo;Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five?&rdquo; So He said, &ldquo;If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it.&rdquo;"
15393,454,1,Gen,18029,"And he spoke to Him yet again and said, &ldquo;Suppose there should be forty found there?&rdquo; So He said, &ldquo;I will not do it for the sake of forty.&rdquo;"
15394,455,1,Gen,18030,"Then he said, &ldquo;Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there?&rdquo; So He said, &ldquo;I will not do it if I find thirty there.&rdquo;"
15395,456,1,Gen,18031,"And he said, &ldquo;Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there?&rdquo; So He said, &ldquo;I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.&rdquo;"

15397,458,1,Gen,18033,"So the Lord went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place."
15398,459,1,Gen,19001,"Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground."

15400,461,1,Gen,19003,"But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. Then he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
15401,462,1,Gen,19004,"Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house."

15404,465,1,Gen,19007,"and said, &ldquo;Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly!"
15405,466,1,Gen,19008,"&ldquo;See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.&rdquo;"

15407,468,1,Gen,19010,"But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door."
15408,469,1,Gen,19011,"And they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary trying to find the door."
15409,470,1,Gen,19012,"Then the men said to Lot, &ldquo;Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city &ndash; take them out of this place!"
15410,471,1,Gen,19013,"&ldquo;For we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.&rdquo;"
15411,472,1,Gen,19014,"So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, &ldquo;Get up, get out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city!&rdquo; But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking."
15412,473,1,Gen,19015,"When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry, saying, &ldquo;Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.&rdquo;"
15413,474,1,Gen,19016,"And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wife&rsquo;s hand, and the hands of his two daughters, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city."
15414,475,1,Gen,19017,"So it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that hea said, &ldquo;Escape for your life! Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be destroyed.&rdquo;"

15416,477,1,Gen,19019,"&ldquo;Indeed now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die."
15417,478,1,Gen,19020,"&ldquo;See now, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one; please let me escape there (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.&rdquo;"

15419,480,1,Gen,19022,"&ldquo;Hurry, escape there. For I cannot do anything until you arrive there.&rdquo; Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."

15445,592,1,Gen,23020,So the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place.
15446,593,1,Gen,24001,"Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things."
15447,594,1,Gen,24002,"So Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, &ldquo;Please, put your hand under my thigh,"
15448,595,1,Gen,24003,"&ldquo;and I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell;"
15449,596,1,Gen,24004,"&ldquo;but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my son Isaac.&rdquo;"
15450,597,1,Gen,24005,"And the servant said to him, &ldquo;Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?&rdquo;"
15451,598,1,Gen,24006,"But Abraham said to him, &ldquo;Beware that you do not take my son back there."
15452,599,1,Gen,24007,"&ldquo;The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father&rsquo;s house and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, &lsquo;To your descendantsa I give this land,&rsquo; He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from "
15453,600,1,Gen,24008,"&ldquo;And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be released from this oath; only do not take my son back there.&rdquo;"
15454,601,1,Gen,24009,"So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter."
15455,602,1,Gen,24010,"Then the servant took ten of his master&rsquo;s camels and departed, for all his master&rsquo;s goods were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
15456,603,1,Gen,24011,"And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water."
15457,604,1,Gen,24012,"Then he said, &ldquo;O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
15458,605,1,Gen,24013,"&ldquo;Behold, here I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water."
15459,606,1,Gen,24014,"&ldquo;Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, &lsquo;Please let down your pitcher that I may drink,&rsquo; and she says, &lsquo;Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink&rsquo; &ndash; let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And by this I will know that "
15460,607,1,Gen,24015,"And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&rsquo;s brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder."
15461,608,1,Gen,24016,"Now the young woman was very beautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up."
15462,609,1,Gen,24017,"And the servant ran to meet her and said, &ldquo;Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.&rdquo;"
15463,610,1,Gen,24018,"So she said, &ldquo;Drink, my lord.&rdquo; Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink."
15464,611,1,Gen,24019,"And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, &ldquo;I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.&rdquo;"
15465,612,1,Gen,24020,"Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
15466,613,1,Gen,24021,"And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not."
15467,614,1,Gen,24022,"So it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden nose ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels of gold,"
15468,615,1,Gen,24023,"and said, &ldquo;Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please, is there room in your father&rsquo;s house for us to lodge?&rdquo;"
15469,616,1,Gen,24024,"So she said to him, &ldquo;I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah&rsquo;s son, whom she bore to Nahor.&rdquo;"
15470,617,1,Gen,24025,"Moreover she said to him, &ldquo;We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.&rdquo;"
15471,618,1,Gen,24026,Then the man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord.
15472,619,1,Gen,24027,"And he said, &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master&rsquo;s brethren.&rdquo;"
15473,620,1,Gen,24028,"So the young woman ran and told her mother&rsquo;s household these things."
15474,621,1,Gen,24029,"Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man by the well."
15475,622,1,Gen,24030,"So it came to pass, when he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister&rsquo;s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, &ldquo;Thus the man spoke to me,&rdquo; that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well."
15476,623,1,Gen,24031,"And he said, &ldquo;Come in, O blessed of the Lord! Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.&rdquo;"
15477,624,1,Gen,24032,"Then the man came to the house. And he unloaded the camels, and provided straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him."
15478,625,1,Gen,24033,"Food was set before him to eat, but he said, &ldquo;I will not eat until I have told about my errand.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Speak on.&rdquo;"
15479,626,1,Gen,24034,"So he said, &ldquo;I am Abraham&rsquo;s servant."
15480,627,1,Gen,24035,"&ldquo;The Lord has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys."
15481,628,1,Gen,24036,"&ldquo;And Sarah my master&rsquo;s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has."
15482,629,1,Gen,24037,"&ldquo;Now my master made me swear, saying, &lsquo;You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell; "
15483,630,1,Gen,24038,"&lsquo;but you shall go to my father&rsquo;s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.&rsquo;"
15484,631,1,Gen,24039,"&ldquo;And I said to my master, &lsquo;Perhaps the woman will not follow me.&rsquo;"
15485,632,1,Gen,24040,"&ldquo;But he said to me, &lsquo;The Lord, before whom I walk, will send His angel with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father&rsquo;s house."
15486,633,1,Gen,24041,"&lsquo;You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family; for if they will not give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.&rsquo;"
15487,634,1,Gen,24042,"&ldquo;And this day I came to the well and said, &lsquo;O Lord God of my master Abraham, if You will now prosper the way in which I go,"
15488,635,1,Gen,24043,"&lsquo;behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw water, and I say to her, &ldquo;Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,&rdquo;"
15489,636,1,Gen,24044,"&lsquo;and she says to me, &ldquo;Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,&rdquo; &ndash; let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;"
15490,637,1,Gen,24045,"&ldquo;But before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, &lsquo;Please let me drink.&rsquo;"
15491,638,1,Gen,24046,"&ldquo;And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her shoulder, and said, &lsquo;Drink, and I will give your camels a drink also.&rsquo; So I drank, and she gave the camels a drink also."
15492,639,1,Gen,24047,"&ldquo;Then I asked her, and said, &lsquo;Whose daughter are you?&rsquo; And she said, &lsquo;The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&rsquo;s son, whom Milcah bore to him.&rsquo; So I put the nose ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists."
15493,640,1,Gen,24048,"&ldquo;And I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my master&rsquo;s brother for his son."
15494,641,1,Gen,24049,"&ldquo;Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.&rdquo;"
15495,642,1,Gen,24050,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, &ldquo;The thing comes from the Lord; we cannot speak to you either bad or good."
15496,643,1,Gen,24051,"&ldquo;Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be your master&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s wife, as the Lord has spoken.&rdquo;"
15497,644,1,Gen,24052,"And it came to pass, when Abraham&rsquo;s servant heard their words, that he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth."
15498,645,1,Gen,24053,"Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother."
15499,646,1,Gen,24054,"And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and stayed all night. Then they arose in the morning, and he said, &ldquo;Send me away to my master.&rdquo;"
15500,647,1,Gen,24055,"But her brother and her mother said, &ldquo;Let the young woman stay with us a few days, at least ten; after that she may go.&rdquo;"
15501,648,1,Gen,24056,"And he said to them, &ldquo;Do not hinder me, since the Lord has prospered my way; send me away so that I may go to my master.&rdquo;"
15502,649,1,Gen,24057,"So they said, &ldquo;We will call the young woman and ask her personally.&rdquo;"
15503,650,1,Gen,24058,"Then they called Rebekah and said to her, &ldquo;Will you go with this man?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;"
15504,651,1,Gen,24059,"So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham&rsquo;s servant and his men."
15505,652,1,Gen,24060,"And they blessed Rebekah and said to her: &ldquo;Our sister, may you become The mother of thousands of ten thousands; And may your descendants possess The gates of those who hate them.&rdquo;"
15506,653,1,Gen,24061,"Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed."
15507,654,1,Gen,24062,"Now Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the South."
15508,655,1,Gen,24063,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted his eyes and looked, and there, the camels were coming."
15509,656,1,Gen,24064,"Then Rebekah lifted her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from her camel;"
15510,657,1,Gen,24065,"for she had said to the servant, &ldquo;Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?&rdquo; The servant said, &ldquo;It is my master.&rdquo; So she took a veil and covered herself."
15511,658,1,Gen,24066,And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
15512,659,1,Gen,24067,"Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&rsquo;s tent; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother&rsquo;s death."
15513,660,1,Gen,25001,"Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
15514,661,1,Gen,25002,"And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
15515,662,1,Gen,25003,"Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
15516,663,1,Gen,25004,"And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
15517,664,1,Gen,25005,And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
15518,665,1,Gen,25006,"But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the country of the east."
15519,666,1,Gen,25007,"This is the sum of the years of Abraham&rsquo;s life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years."
15520,667,1,Gen,25008,"Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people."
15521,668,1,Gen,25009,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,"
15522,669,1,Gen,25010,"the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife."
15523,670,1,Gen,25011,"And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi."
15524,671,1,Gen,25012,"Now this is the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&rsquo;s maidservant, bore to Abraham."
15525,672,1,Gen,25013,"And these were the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
15526,673,1,Gen,25014,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
15527,674,1,Gen,25015,"Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
15528,675,1,Gen,25016,"These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their towns and their settlements, twelve princes according to their nations."
15529,676,1,Gen,25017,"These were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people."
15530,677,1,Gen,25018,"(They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria.) He died in the presence of all his brethren."
15531,678,1,Gen,25019,"This is the genealogy of Isaac, Abraham&rsquo;s son. Abraham begot Isaac."
15532,679,1,Gen,25020,"Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian."
15533,680,1,Gen,25021,"Now Isaac pleaded with the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
15534,681,1,Gen,25022,"But the children struggled together within her; and she said, &ldquo;If all is well, why am I like this?&rdquo; So she went to inquire of the Lord."
15535,682,1,Gen,25023,"And the Lord said to her: &ldquo;Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger.&rdquo;"
15536,683,1,Gen,25024,"So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, indeed there were twins in her womb."
15537,684,1,Gen,25025,"And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; so they called his name Esau."
15538,685,1,Gen,25026,"Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau&rsquo;s heel; so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them."
15539,686,1,Gen,25027,"So the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a mild man, dwelling in tents."
15540,687,1,Gen,25028,"And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
15541,688,1,Gen,25029,"Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was weary."
15542,689,1,Gen,25030,"And Esau said to Jacob, &ldquo;Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am weary.&rdquo; Therefore his name was called Edom."
15543,690,1,Gen,25031,"But Jacob said, &ldquo;Sell me your birthright as of this day.&rdquo;"
15544,691,1,Gen,25032,"And Esau said, &ldquo;Look, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to me?&rdquo;"
15545,692,1,Gen,25033,"Then Jacob said, &ldquo;Swear to me as of this day.&rdquo; So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob."
15546,693,1,Gen,25034,"And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright."
15547,694,1,Gen,26001,"There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, in Gerar."
15548,695,1,Gen,26002,"Then the Lord appeared to him and said: &ldquo;Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you."
15549,696,1,Gen,26003,"&ldquo;Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your descendants I give all these lands, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father."
15550,697,1,Gen,26004,"&ldquo;And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;"
15551,698,1,Gen,26005,"&ldquo;because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.&rdquo;"
15552,699,1,Gen,26006,So Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
15553,700,1,Gen,26007,"And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, &ldquo;She is my sister&rdquo;; for he was afraid to say, &ldquo;She is my wife,&rdquo; because he thought, &ldquo;lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to behold.&rdquo;"
15554,701,1,Gen,26008,"Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac, showing endearment to Rebekah his wife."
15555,702,1,Gen,26009,"Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, &ldquo;Quite obviously she is your wife; so how could you say, &lsquo;She is my sister&rsquo;?&rdquo; Isaac said to him, &ldquo;Because I said, &lsquo;Lest I die on account of her.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
15556,703,1,Gen,26010,"And Abimelech said, &ldquo;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.&rdquo;"
15557,704,1,Gen,26011,"So Abimelech charged all his people, saying, &ldquo;He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&rdquo;"
15558,705,1,Gen,26012,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him."
15559,706,1,Gen,26013,"The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous;"
15560,707,1,Gen,26014,for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines envied him.
15561,708,1,Gen,26015,"Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father&rsquo;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth."
15562,709,1,Gen,26016,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, &ldquo;Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.&rdquo;"
15563,710,1,Gen,26017,"Then Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
15564,711,1,Gen,26018,"And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. He called them by the names which his father had called them."
15565,712,1,Gen,26019,"Also Isaac&rsquo;s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there."
15566,713,1,Gen,26020,"But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac&rsquo;s herdsmen, saying, &ldquo;The water is ours.&rdquo; So he called the name of the well Esek, because they quarreled with him."
15567,714,1,Gen,26021,"Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also. So he called its name Sitnah."
15568,715,1,Gen,26022,"And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, &ldquo;For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.&rdquo;"
15569,716,1,Gen,26023,Then he went up from there to Beersheba.
15570,717,1,Gen,26024,"And the Lord appeared to him the same night and said, &ldquo;I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My servant Abraham&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;"
15571,718,1,Gen,26025,"So he built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac&rsquo;s servants dug a well."
15572,719,1,Gen,26026,"Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol the commander of his army."
15573,720,1,Gen,26027,"And Isaac said to them, &ldquo;Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?&rdquo;"
15574,721,1,Gen,26028,"But they said, &ldquo;We have certainly seen that the Lord is with you. So we said, &lsquo;Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a covenant with you,"
15575,722,1,Gen,26029,"&lsquo;that you will do us no harm, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
15576,723,1,Gen,26030,"So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
15577,724,1,Gen,26031,"Then they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
15578,725,1,Gen,26032,"It came to pass the same day that Isaac&rsquo;s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, &ldquo;We have found water.&rdquo;"
15579,726,1,Gen,26033,So he called it Shebah.a Therefore the name of the city is Beershebab to this day.
15580,727,1,Gen,26034,"When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
15581,728,1,Gen,26035,And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
15582,729,1,Gen,27001,"Now it came to pass, when Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see, that he called Esau his older son and said to him, &ldquo;My son.&rdquo; And he answered him, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;"
15583,730,1,Gen,27002,"Then he said, &ldquo;Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death."
15584,731,1,Gen,27003,"&ldquo;Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me."
15585,732,1,Gen,27004,"&ldquo;And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.&rdquo;"
15586,733,1,Gen,27005,Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it.
15587,734,1,Gen,27006,"So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, &ldquo;Indeed I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,"
15588,735,1,Gen,27007,"&lsquo;Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of the Lord before my death.&rsquo;"
15589,736,1,Gen,27008,"&ldquo;Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you."
15590,737,1,Gen,27009,"&ldquo;Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves."
15591,823,1,Gen,29027,"&ldquo;Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years.&rdquo;"
15592,824,1,Gen,29028,Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also.
15593,825,1,Gen,29029,And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maid.
15594,826,1,Gen,29030,"Then Jacob also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with Laban still another seven years."
15595,827,1,Gen,29031,"When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren."
15596,828,1,Gen,29032,"So Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, &ldquo;The Lord has surely looked on my affliction. Now therefore, my husband will love me.&rdquo;"
15597,829,1,Gen,29033,"Then she conceived again and bore a son, and said, &ldquo;Because the Lord has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also.&rdquo; And she called his name Simeon."
15598,830,1,Gen,29034,"She conceived again and bore a son, and said, &ldquo;Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&rdquo; Therefore his name was called Levi."
15599,831,1,Gen,29035,"And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, &ldquo;Now I will praise the Lord.&rdquo; Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped bearing."
15600,832,1,Gen,30001,"Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said to Jacob, &ldquo;Give me children, or else I die!&rdquo;"
15601,833,1,Gen,30002,"And Jacob&rsquo;s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, &ldquo;Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&rdquo;"
15602,834,1,Gen,30003,"So she said, &ldquo;Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she will bear a child on my knees, that I also may have children by her.&rdquo;"
15603,835,1,Gen,30004,"Then she gave him Bilhah her maid as wife, and Jacob went in to her."
15604,836,1,Gen,30005,And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
15605,837,1,Gen,30006,"Then Rachel said, &ldquo;God has judged my case; and He has also heard my voice and given me a son.&rdquo; Therefore she called his name Dan."
15606,838,1,Gen,30007,"And Rachel&rsquo;s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son."
15607,839,1,Gen,30008,"Then Rachel said, &ldquo;With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and indeed I have prevailed.&rdquo; So she called his name Naphtali."
15608,840,1,Gen,30009,"When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as wife."
15609,841,1,Gen,30010,"And Leah&rsquo;s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son."
15610,842,1,Gen,30011,"Then Leah said, &ldquo;A troop comes!&rdquo;a So she called his name Gad."
15611,843,1,Gen,30012,"And Leah&rsquo;s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son."
15612,844,1,Gen,30013,"Then Leah said, &ldquo;I am happy, for the daughters will call me blessed.&rdquo; So she called his name Asher."
15613,845,1,Gen,30014,"Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, &ldquo;Please give me some of your son&rsquo;s mandrakes.&rdquo;"
15614,846,1,Gen,30015,"But she said to her, &ldquo;Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son&rsquo;s mandrakes also?&rdquo; And Rachel said, &ldquo;Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son&rsquo;s mandrakes.&rdquo;"
15615,847,1,Gen,30016,"When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, &ldquo;You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son&rsquo;s mandrakes.&rdquo; And he lay with her that night."
15616,848,1,Gen,30017,"And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son."
15617,849,1,Gen,30018,"Leah said, &ldquo;God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband.&rdquo; So she called his name Issachar."
15618,850,1,Gen,30019,Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
15619,851,1,Gen,30020,"And Leah said, &ldquo;God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.&rdquo; So she called his name Zebulun."
15620,852,1,Gen,30021,"Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
15621,853,1,Gen,30022,"Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb."
15622,854,1,Gen,30023,"And she conceived and bore a son, and said, &ldquo;God has taken away my reproach.&rdquo;"
15623,855,1,Gen,30024,"So she called his name Joseph, and said, &ldquo;The Lord shall add to me another son.&rdquo;"
15624,856,1,Gen,30025,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, &ldquo;Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my country."
15625,857,1,Gen,30026,"&ldquo;Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service which I have done for you.&rdquo;"
15626,858,1,Gen,30027,"And Laban said to him, &ldquo;Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes, for I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for your sake.&rdquo;"
15627,859,1,Gen,30028,"Then he said, &ldquo;Name me your wages, and I will give it.&rdquo;"
15628,860,1,Gen,30029,"So Jacob said to him, &ldquo;You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me."
15629,861,1,Gen,30030,"&ldquo;For what you had before I came was little, and it has increased to a great amount; the Lord has blessed you since my coming. And now, when shall I also provide for my own house?&rdquo;"
15630,862,1,Gen,30031,"So he said, &ldquo;What shall I give you?&rdquo; And Jacob said, &ldquo;You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flocks:"
15631,863,1,Gen,30032,"&ldquo;Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and these shall be my wages."
15632,864,1,Gen,30033,"&ldquo;So my righteousness will answer for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if it is with me.&rdquo;"
15633,865,1,Gen,30034,"And Laban said, &ldquo;Oh, that it were according to your word!&rdquo;"
15634,866,1,Gen,30035,"So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
15635,867,1,Gen,30036,"Then he put three days&rsquo; journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban&rsquo;s flocks."
15636,868,1,Gen,30037,"Now Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which was in the rods."
15637,869,1,Gen,30038,"And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should conceive when they came to drink."
15638,870,1,Gen,30039,"So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted."
15639,871,1,Gen,30040,"Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban&rsquo;s flock."
15640,872,1,Gen,30041,"And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
15641,873,1,Gen,30042,"But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban&rsquo;s and the stronger Jacob&rsquo;s."
15642,874,1,Gen,30043,"Thus the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
15643,875,1,Gen,31001,"Now Jacob heard the words of Laban&rsquo;s sons, saying, &ldquo;Jacob has taken away all that was our father&rsquo;s, and from what was our father&rsquo;s he has acquired all this wealth.&rdquo;"
15644,876,1,Gen,31002,"And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and indeed it was not favorable toward him as before."
15645,877,1,Gen,31003,"Then the Lord said to Jacob, &ldquo;Return to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will be with you.&rdquo;"
15646,878,1,Gen,31004,"So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock,"
15647,879,1,Gen,31005,"and said to them, &ldquo;I see your father&rsquo;s countenance, that it is not favorable toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me."
15648,880,1,Gen,31006,"&ldquo;And you know that with all my might I have served your father."
15649,881,1,Gen,31007,"&ldquo;Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me."
15650,882,1,Gen,31008,"&ldquo;If he said thus: &lsquo;The speckled shall be your wages,&rsquo; then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: &lsquo;The streaked shall be your wages,&rsquo; then all the flocks bore streaked."
15651,883,1,Gen,31009,"&ldquo;So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me."
15652,884,1,Gen,31010,"&ldquo;And it happened, at the time when the flocks conceived, that I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks were streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted."
15653,885,1,Gen,31011,"&ldquo;Then the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, &lsquo;Jacob.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo;"
15654,886,1,Gen,31012,"&ldquo;And He said, &lsquo;Lift your eyes now and see, all the rams which leap on the flocks are streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you."
15655,887,1,Gen,31013,"&lsquo;I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you made a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your family.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
15656,888,1,Gen,31014,"Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, &ldquo;Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father&rsquo;s house?"
15657,889,1,Gen,31015,"&ldquo;Are we not considered strangers by him? For he has sold us, and also completely consumed our money."
15658,890,1,Gen,31016,"&ldquo;For all these riches which God has taken from our father are really ours and our children&rsquo;s; now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.&rdquo;"
15659,891,1,Gen,31017,Then Jacob rose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
15660,892,1,Gen,31018,"And he carried away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Padan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan."
15661,893,1,Gen,31019,"Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household idols that were her father&rsquo;s."
15662,894,1,Gen,31020,"And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee."
15663,895,1,Gen,31021,"So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and headed toward the mountains of Gilead."
15664,896,1,Gen,31022,And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.
15665,897,1,Gen,31023,"Then he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days&rsquo; journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead."
15666,898,1,Gen,31024,"But God had come to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, &ldquo;Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.&rdquo;"
15667,899,1,Gen,31025,"So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead."
15668,900,1,Gen,31026,"And Laban said to Jacob: &ldquo;What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and carried away my daughters like captives taken with the sword?"
15669,901,1,Gen,31027,"&ldquo;Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp?"
15670,902,1,Gen,31028,"&ldquo;And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing."
15671,903,1,Gen,31029,"&ldquo;It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, &lsquo;Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.&rsquo;"
15672,904,1,Gen,31030,"&ldquo;And now you have surely gone because you greatly long for your father&rsquo;s house, but why did you steal my gods?&rdquo;"
15673,905,1,Gen,31031,"Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, &ldquo;Because I was afraid, for I said, &lsquo;Perhaps you would take your daughters from me by force.&rsquo;"
15674,906,1,Gen,31032,"&ldquo;With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you.&rdquo; For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them."
15675,907,1,Gen,31033,"And Laban went into Jacob&rsquo;s tent, into Leah&rsquo;s tent, and into the two maids&rsquo; tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah&rsquo;s tent and entered Rachel&rsquo;s tent."
15676,17695,1,Jer,12009,"My heritage is to Me like a speckled vulture; The vultures all around are against her. Come, assemble all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour!"
15677,17696,1,Jer,12010,"&ldquo;Many rulers have destroyed My vineyard, They have trodden My portion underfoot; They have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness."
15678,959,1,Gen,32030,"So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: &ldquo;For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&rdquo;"
15679,960,1,Gen,32031,"Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he limped on his hip."
15680,961,1,Gen,32032,"Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle that shrank, which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacob&rsquo;s hip in the muscle that shrank."
15681,962,1,Gen,33001,"Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants."
15682,963,1,Gen,33002,"And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last."
15683,964,1,Gen,33003,"Then he crossed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
15684,965,1,Gen,33004,"But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept."
15685,966,1,Gen,33005,"And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, &ldquo;Who are these with you?&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;The children whom God has graciously given your servant.&rdquo;"
15686,967,1,Gen,33006,"Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down."
15687,968,1,Gen,33007,"And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down."
15688,969,1,Gen,33008,"Then Esau said, &ldquo;What do you mean by all this company which I met?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;These are to find favor in the sight of my lord.&rdquo;"
15689,970,1,Gen,33009,"But Esau said, &ldquo;I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.&rdquo;"
15690,971,1,Gen,33010,"And Jacob said, &ldquo;No, please, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me."
15691,972,1,Gen,33011,"&ldquo;Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.&rdquo; So he urged him, and he took it."
15692,973,1,Gen,33012,"Then Esau said, &ldquo;Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.&rdquo;"
15693,974,1,Gen,33013,"But Jacob said to him, &ldquo;My lord knows that the children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die."
15694,975,1,Gen,33014,"&ldquo;Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on slowly at a pace which the livestock that go before me, and the children, are able to endure, until I come to my lord in Seir.&rdquo;"
15695,976,1,Gen,33015,"And Esau said, &ldquo;Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.&rdquo;"
15696,977,1,Gen,33016,So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
15697,978,1,Gen,33017,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
15698,979,1,Gen,33018,"Then Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram; and he pitched his tent before the city."
15699,980,1,Gen,33019,"And he bought the parcel of land, where he had pitched his tent, from the children of Hamor, Shechem&rsquo;s father, for one hundred pieces of money."
15700,981,1,Gen,33020,Then he erected an altar there and called it El Elohe Israel.
15701,982,1,Gen,34001,"Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
15702,983,1,Gen,34002,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and violated her."
15703,984,1,Gen,34003,"His soul was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke kindly to the young woman."
15704,985,1,Gen,34004,"So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, &ldquo;Get me this young woman as a wife.&rdquo;"
15705,986,1,Gen,34005,"And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held his peace until they came."
15706,987,1,Gen,34006,Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
15707,988,1,Gen,34007,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved and very angry, because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob&rsquo;s daughter, a thing which ought not to be done."
15708,989,1,Gen,34008,"But Hamor spoke with them, saying, &ldquo;The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife."
15709,990,1,Gen,34009,"&ldquo;And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves."
15710,991,1,Gen,34010,"&ldquo;So you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions for yourselves in it.&rdquo;"
15711,992,1,Gen,34011,"Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers, &ldquo;Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give."
15712,993,1,Gen,34012,"&ldquo;Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the young woman as a wife.&rdquo;"
15713,994,1,Gen,34013,"But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister."
15714,995,1,Gen,34014,"And they said to them, &ldquo;We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us."
15715,996,1,Gen,34015,"&ldquo;But on this condition we will consent to you: If you will become as we are, if every male of you is circumcised,"
15716,997,1,Gen,34016,"&ldquo;then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
15717,998,1,Gen,34017,"&ldquo;But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.&rdquo;"
15718,999,1,Gen,34018,"And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor&rsquo;s son."
15719,1000,1,Gen,34019,"So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob&rsquo;s daughter. He was more honorable than all the household of his father."
15720,1001,1,Gen,34020,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying:"
15721,1002,1,Gen,34021,"&ldquo;These men are at peace with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give them our daughters."
15722,1003,1,Gen,34022,"&ldquo;Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised."
15723,1004,1,Gen,34023,"&ldquo;Will not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.&rdquo;"
15724,1005,1,Gen,34024,"And all who went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city."
15725,1006,1,Gen,34025,"Now it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&rsquo;s brothers, each took his sword and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males."
15726,1007,1,Gen,34026,"And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem&rsquo;s house, and went out."
15727,1008,1,Gen,34027,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled."
15728,1009,1,Gen,34028,"They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what was in the city and what was in the field,"
15729,1010,1,Gen,34029,"and all their wealth. All their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that was in the houses."
15730,1011,1,Gen,34030,"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &ldquo;You have troubled me by making me obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall"
15731,1012,1,Gen,34031,"But they said, &ldquo;Should he treat our sister like a harlot?&rdquo;"
15732,1013,1,Gen,35001,"Then God said to Jacob, &ldquo;Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.&rdquo;"
15733,1014,1,Gen,35002,"And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &ldquo;Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments."
15734,1015,1,Gen,35003,"&ldquo;Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.&rdquo;"
15735,1016,1,Gen,35004,"So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which was by Shechem."
15736,1017,1,Gen,35005,"And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."
15737,1018,1,Gen,35006,"So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him."
15738,1019,1,Gen,35007,"And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother."
15739,1020,1,Gen,35008,"Now Deborah, Rebekah&rsquo;s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth."
15740,1021,1,Gen,35009,"Then God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and blessed him."
15741,1022,1,Gen,35010,"And God said to him, &ldquo;Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name.&rdquo; So He called his name Israel."
15742,1023,1,Gen,35011,"Also God said to him: &ldquo;I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come from your body."
15743,1024,1,Gen,35012,"&ldquo;The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants after you I give this land.&rdquo;"
15744,1025,1,Gen,35013,Then God went up from him in the place where He talked with him.
15745,1026,1,Gen,35014,"So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it."
15746,1027,1,Gen,35015,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel."
15747,1028,1,Gen,35016,"Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored in childbirth, and she had hard labor."
15748,1029,1,Gen,35017,"Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, &ldquo;Do not fear; you will have this son also.&rdquo;"
15749,1030,1,Gen,35018,"And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin."
15750,1031,1,Gen,35019,"So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
15751,1032,1,Gen,35020,"And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachel&rsquo;s grave to this day."
15752,1033,1,Gen,35021,Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
15753,1034,1,Gen,35022,"And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&rsquo;s concubine; and Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
15754,1035,1,Gen,35023,"the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;"
15755,1036,1,Gen,35024,"the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;"
15756,1037,1,Gen,35025,"the sons of Bilhah, Rachel&rsquo;s maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;"
15757,1038,1,Gen,35026,"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah&rsquo;s maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram."
15758,1039,1,Gen,35027,"Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirjath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt."
15759,1040,1,Gen,35028,Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
15760,1041,1,Gen,35029,"So Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
15761,1042,1,Gen,36001,"Now this is the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom."
15762,1043,1,Gen,36002,"Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
15763,1044,1,Gen,36003,"and Basemath, Ishmael&rsquo;s daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
15764,1045,1,Gen,36004,"Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel."
15765,1046,1,Gen,36005,"And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
15766,1047,1,Gen,36006,"Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob."
15767,1048,1,Gen,36007,"For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock."
15768,1049,1,Gen,36008,So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
15769,1050,1,Gen,36009,And this is the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.
15770,1051,1,Gen,36010,"These were the names of Esau&rsquo;s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
15771,1052,1,Gen,36011,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz."
15772,1053,1,Gen,36012,"Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, Esau&rsquo;s son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esau&rsquo;s wife."
15773,1054,1,Gen,36013,"These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau&rsquo;s wife."
15774,1055,1,Gen,36014,"These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau&rsquo;s wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah."
15775,1056,1,Gen,36015,"These were the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,"
15776,1057,1,Gen,36016,"Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. They were the sons of Adah."
15777,1058,1,Gen,36017,"These were the sons of Reuel, Esau&rsquo;s son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau&rsquo;s wife."
15778,1059,1,Gen,36018,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau&rsquo;s wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs who descended from Aholibamah, Esau&rsquo;s wife, the daughter of Anah."
15779,1060,1,Gen,36019,"These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these were their chiefs."
15780,1061,1,Gen,36020,"These were the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
15781,1062,1,Gen,36021,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom."
15782,1063,1,Gen,36022,"And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan&rsquo;s sister was Timna."
15783,1064,1,Gen,36023,"These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
15784,1065,1,Gen,36024,These were the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
15785,1066,1,Gen,36025,These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
15786,1067,1,Gen,36026,"These were the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran."
15787,1068,1,Gen,36027,"These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan."
15788,1069,1,Gen,36028,These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
15789,1070,1,Gen,36029,"These were the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,"
15790,1071,1,Gen,36030,"Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir."
15791,1072,1,Gen,36031,Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel:
15792,1073,1,Gen,36032,"Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah."
15793,1074,1,Gen,36033,"And when Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place."
15794,1075,1,Gen,36034,"When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place."
15795,1076,1,Gen,36035,"And when Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who attacked Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith."
15796,1077,1,Gen,36036,"When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place."
15797,1078,1,Gen,36037,"And when Samlah died, Saul of Rehoboth-by-the-River reigned in his place."
15798,1079,1,Gen,36038,"When Saul died, Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place."
15799,1080,1,Gen,36039,"And when Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Pau. His wife&rsquo;s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
15800,1081,1,Gen,36040,"And these were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,"
15801,1082,1,Gen,36041,"Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,"
15802,1083,1,Gen,36042,"Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar,"
15803,1084,1,Gen,36043,"Chief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession. Esau was the father of the Edomites."
15804,1085,1,Gen,37001,"Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
15805,1086,1,Gen,37002,"This is the history of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father&rsquo;s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to his father."
15806,1087,1,Gen,37003,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a tunic of many colors."
15807,1088,1,Gen,37004,"But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him."
15808,1089,1,Gen,37005,"Now Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more."
15809,1090,1,Gen,37006,"So he said to them, &ldquo;Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:"
15810,1091,1,Gen,37007,"&ldquo;There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.&rdquo;"
15811,1092,1,Gen,37008,"And his brothers said to him, &ldquo;Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?&rdquo; So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words."
15812,1093,1,Gen,37009,"Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, &ldquo;Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.&rdquo;"
15813,1094,1,Gen,37010,"So he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, &ldquo;What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?&rdquo;"
15814,1095,1,Gen,37011,"And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter in mind."
15815,1096,1,Gen,37012,"Then his brothers went to feed their father&rsquo;s flock in Shechem."
15816,1097,1,Gen,37013,"And Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.&rdquo; So he said to him, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;"
15817,1098,1,Gen,37014,"Then he said to him, &ldquo;Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me.&rdquo; So he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem."
15818,1099,1,Gen,37015,"Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, &ldquo;What are you seeking?&rdquo;"
15819,1100,1,Gen,37016,"So he said, &ldquo;I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks.&rdquo;"
15820,1101,1,Gen,37017,"And the man said, &ldquo;They have departed from here, for I heard them say, &lsquo;Let us go to Dothan.&rsquo;&rdquo; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan."
15821,1102,1,Gen,37018,"Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him."
15822,1103,1,Gen,37019,"Then they said to one another, &ldquo;Look, this dreamer is coming!"
15823,1104,1,Gen,37020,"&ldquo;Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, &lsquo;Some wild beast has devoured him.&rsquo; We shall see what will become of his dreams!&rdquo;"
15824,1105,1,Gen,37021,"But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, &ldquo;Let us not kill him.&rdquo;"
15825,1106,1,Gen,37022,"And Reuben said to them, &ldquo;Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him&rdquo; &ndash; that he might deliver him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father."
15826,1107,1,Gen,37023,"So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him."
15827,1108,1,Gen,37024,"Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it."
15828,1109,1,Gen,37025,"And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead with their camels, bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry them down to Egypt."
15829,1110,1,Gen,37026,"So Judah said to his brothers, &ldquo;What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"
15830,1111,1,Gen,37027,"&ldquo;Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh.&rdquo; And his brothers listened."
15831,1112,1,Gen,37028,"Then Midianite traders passed by; so the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt."
15832,1113,1,Gen,37029,"Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes."
15833,1114,1,Gen,37030,"And he returned to his brothers and said, &ldquo;The lad is no more; and I, where shall I go?&rdquo;"
15834,1115,1,Gen,37031,"So they took Joseph&rsquo;s tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood."
15835,1116,1,Gen,37032,"Then they sent the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father and said, &ldquo;We have found this. Do you know whether it is your son&rsquo;s tunic or not?&rdquo;"
15836,1117,1,Gen,37033,"And he recognized it and said, &ldquo;It is my son&rsquo;s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.&rdquo;"
15837,1118,1,Gen,37034,"Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days."
15838,1119,1,Gen,37035,"And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, &ldquo;For I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning.&rdquo; Thus his father wept for him."
15839,1120,1,Gen,37036,"Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard."
15840,1121,1,Gen,38001,"It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah."
15841,1122,1,Gen,38002,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her and went in to her."
15842,1123,1,Gen,38003,"So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er."
15843,1124,1,Gen,38004,"She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan."
15844,1125,1,Gen,38005,"And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him."
15845,1126,1,Gen,38006,"Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
15846,1127,1,Gen,38007,"But Er, Judah&rsquo;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord killed him."
15847,1128,1,Gen,38008,"And Judah said to Onan, &ldquo;Go in to your brother&rsquo;s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.&rdquo;"
15848,1129,1,Gen,38009,"But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother&rsquo;s wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should give an heir to his brother."
15849,1130,1,Gen,38010,"And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He killed him also."
15850,1217,1,Gen,41021,"&ldquo;When they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were just as ugly as at the beginning. So I awoke."
15851,1218,1,Gen,41022,"&ldquo;Also I saw in my dream, and suddenly seven heads came up on one stalk, full and good."
15852,1219,1,Gen,41023,"&ldquo;Then behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them."
15853,1220,1,Gen,41024,"&ldquo;And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. So I told this to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.&rdquo;"
15854,1221,1,Gen,41025,"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:"
15855,1222,1,Gen,41026,"&ldquo;The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one."
15856,1223,1,Gen,41027,"&ldquo;And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are seven years of famine."
15857,1224,1,Gen,41028,"&ldquo;This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do."
15858,1225,1,Gen,41029,"&ldquo;Indeed seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of Egypt;"
15859,1226,1,Gen,41030,"&ldquo;but after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land."
15860,1227,1,Gen,41031,"&ldquo;So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following, for it will be very severe."
15861,1228,1,Gen,41032,"&ldquo;And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
15862,1229,1,Gen,41033,"&ldquo;Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt."
15863,1230,1,Gen,41034,"&ldquo;Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years."
15864,1231,1,Gen,41035,"&ldquo;And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
15865,1232,1,Gen,41036,"&ldquo;Then that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.&rdquo;"
15866,1233,1,Gen,41037,So the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
15867,1234,1,Gen,41038,"And Pharaoh said to his servants, &ldquo;Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?&rdquo;"
15868,1235,1,Gen,41039,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you."
15869,1236,1,Gen,41040,"&ldquo;You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.&rdquo;"
15870,1237,1,Gen,41041,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&rdquo;"
15871,1238,1,Gen,41042,"Then Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph&rsquo;s hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck."
15872,1239,1,Gen,41043,"And he had him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, &ldquo;Bow the knee!&rdquo; So he set him over all the land of Egypt."
15873,1240,1,Gen,41044,"Pharaoh also said to Joseph, &ldquo;I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&rdquo;"
15874,1241,1,Gen,41045,"And Pharaoh called Joseph&rsquo;s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt."
15875,1242,1,Gen,41046,"Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
15876,1243,1,Gen,41047,Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth abundantly.
15877,1244,1,Gen,41048,"So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them."
15878,1245,1,Gen,41049,"Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for it was immeasurable."
15879,1246,1,Gen,41050,"And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him."
15880,1247,1,Gen,41051,"Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: &ldquo;For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;"
15881,1248,1,Gen,41052,"And the name of the second he called Ephraim: &ldquo;For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.&rdquo;"
15882,1249,1,Gen,41053,"Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended,"
15883,1250,1,Gen,41054,"and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. The famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
15884,1251,1,Gen,41055,"So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &ldquo;Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.&rdquo;"
15885,1252,1,Gen,41056,"The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt."
15886,1253,1,Gen,41057,"So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all lands."
15887,1254,1,Gen,42001,"When Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, &ldquo;Why do you look at one another?&rdquo;"
15888,1255,1,Gen,42002,"And he said, &ldquo;Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down to that place and buy for us there, that we may live and not die.&rdquo;"
15889,1256,1,Gen,42003,"So Joseph&rsquo;s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt."
15890,1257,1,Gen,42004,"But Jacob did not send Joseph&rsquo;s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, &ldquo;Lest some calamity befall him.&rdquo;"
15891,1258,1,Gen,42005,"And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
15892,1259,1,Gen,42006,"Now Joseph was governor over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph&rsquo;s brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the earth."
15893,1260,1,Gen,42007,"Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke roughly to them. Then he said to them, &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;From the land of Canaan to buy food.&rdquo;"
15894,1261,1,Gen,42008,"So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."
15895,1262,1,Gen,42009,"Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, &ldquo;You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!&rdquo;"
15896,1263,1,Gen,42010,"And they said to him, &ldquo;No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food."
15897,1264,1,Gen,42011,"&ldquo;We are all one man&rsquo;s sons; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.&rdquo;"
15898,1265,1,Gen,42012,"But he said to them, &ldquo;No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.&rdquo;"
15899,1266,1,Gen,42013,"And they said, &ldquo;Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.&rdquo;"
15900,1267,1,Gen,42014,"But Joseph said to them, &ldquo;It is as I spoke to you, saying, &lsquo;You are spies!&rsquo;"
15901,1268,1,Gen,42015,"&ldquo;In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here."
15902,1269,1,Gen,42016,"&ldquo;Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!&rdquo;"
15903,1270,1,Gen,42017,So he put them all together in prison three days.
15904,1271,1,Gen,42018,"Then Joseph said to them the third day, &ldquo;Do this and live, for I fear God:"
15905,1272,1,Gen,42019,"&ldquo;If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses."
15906,1273,1,Gen,42020,"&ldquo;And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.&rdquo; And they did so."
15907,1274,1,Gen,42021,"Then they said to one another, &ldquo;We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not hear; therefore this distress has come upon us.&rdquo;"
15908,1275,1,Gen,42022,"And Reuben answered them, saying, &ldquo;Did I not speak to you, saying, &lsquo;Do not sin against the boy&rsquo;; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now required of us.&rdquo;"
15909,1276,1,Gen,42023,"But they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter."
15910,1277,1,Gen,42024,"And he turned himself away from them and wept. Then he returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes."
15911,1278,1,Gen,42025,"Then Joseph gave a command to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every man&rsquo;s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them."
15912,1279,1,Gen,42026,So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.
15913,1280,1,Gen,42027,"But as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the encampment, he saw his money; and there it was, in the mouth of his sack."
15914,1281,1,Gen,42028,"So he said to his brothers, &ldquo;My money has been restored, and there it is, in my sack!&rdquo; Then their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying to one another, &ldquo;What is this that God has done to us?&rdquo;"
15915,1282,1,Gen,42029,"Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying:"
15916,1283,1,Gen,42030,"&ldquo;The man who is lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
15917,1284,1,Gen,42031,"&ldquo;But we said to him, &lsquo;We are honest men; we are not spies."
15918,1285,1,Gen,42032,"&lsquo;We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.&rsquo;"
15919,1286,1,Gen,42033,"&ldquo;Then the man, the lord of the country, said to us, &lsquo;By this I will know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your households, and be gone."
15920,1287,1,Gen,42034,"&lsquo;And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. I will grant your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
15921,1288,1,Gen,42035,"Then it happened as they emptied their sacks, that surprisingly each man&rsquo;s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
15922,1289,1,Gen,42036,"And Jacob their father said to them, &ldquo;You have bereaved me: Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin. All these things are against me.&rdquo;"
15923,1290,1,Gen,42037,"Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, &ldquo;Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.&rdquo;"
15924,1291,1,Gen,42038,"But he said, &ldquo;My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any calamity should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.&rdquo;"
15925,1292,1,Gen,43001,Now the famine was severe in the land.
15926,1293,1,Gen,43002,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, &ldquo;Go back, buy us a little food.&rdquo;"
15927,1294,1,Gen,43003,"But Judah spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;The man solemnly warned us, saying, &lsquo;You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.&rsquo;"
15928,1295,1,Gen,43004,"&ldquo;If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food."
15929,1296,1,Gen,43005,"&ldquo;But if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, &lsquo;You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
15930,1297,1,Gen,43006,"And Israel said, &ldquo;Why did you deal so wrongfully with me as to tell the man whether you had still another brother?&rdquo;"
15931,1298,1,Gen,43007,"But they said, &ldquo;The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family, saying, &lsquo;Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?&rsquo; And we told him according to these words. Could we possibly have known that he would say, &lsquo;Bring your brother down&rsquo;?"
15932,1299,1,Gen,43008,"Then Judah said to Israel his father, &ldquo;Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones."
15933,1300,1,Gen,43009,"&ldquo;I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever."
15934,1301,1,Gen,43010,"&ldquo;For if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.&rdquo;"
15935,1302,1,Gen,43011,"And their father Israel said to them, &ldquo;If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down a present for the man &ndash; a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds."
15936,1303,1,Gen,43012,"&ldquo;Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight."
15937,1304,1,Gen,43013,"&ldquo;Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man."
15938,1305,1,Gen,43014,"&ldquo;And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!&rdquo;"
15939,1306,1,Gen,43015,"So the men took that present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went down to Egypt; and they stood before Joseph."
15940,1307,1,Gen,43016,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, &ldquo;Take these men to my home, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for these men will dine with me at noon.&rdquo;"
15941,1308,1,Gen,43017,"Then the man did as Joseph ordered, and the man brought the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house."
15942,1309,1,Gen,43018,"Now the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph&rsquo;s house; and they said, &ldquo;It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may make a case against us and seize us, to take us as sl"
15943,1310,1,Gen,43019,"When they drew near to the steward of Joseph&rsquo;s house, they talked with him at the door of the house,"
15944,1311,1,Gen,43020,"and said, &ldquo;O sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food;"
15945,1312,1,Gen,43021,"&ldquo;but it happened, when we came to the encampment, that we opened our sacks, and there, each man&rsquo;s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand."
15946,1313,1,Gen,43022,"&ldquo;And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.&rdquo;"
15947,1314,1,Gen,43023,"But he said, &ldquo;Peace be with you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.&rdquo; Then he brought Simeon out to them."
15948,1315,1,Gen,43024,"So the man brought the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed."
15949,1316,1,Gen,43025,"Then they made the present ready for Joseph&rsquo;s coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there."
15950,1317,1,Gen,43026,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down before him to the earth."
15951,1318,1,Gen,43027,"Then he asked them about their well-being, and said, &ldquo;Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?&rdquo;"
15952,1319,1,Gen,43028,"And they answered, &ldquo;Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive.&rdquo; And they bowed their heads down and prostrated themselves."
15953,1320,1,Gen,43029,"Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&rsquo;s son, and said, &ldquo;Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;God be gracious to you, my son.&rdquo;"
15954,1321,1,Gen,43030,"Now his heart yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought somewhere to weep. And he went into his chamber and wept there."
15955,1322,1,Gen,43031,"Then he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, &ldquo;Serve the bread.&rdquo;"
15956,1323,1,Gen,43032,"So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians."
15957,1324,1,Gen,43033,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked in astonishment at one another."
15958,1325,1,Gen,43034,"Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin&rsquo;s serving was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him."
15959,1326,1,Gen,44001,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, &ldquo;Fill the men&rsquo;s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man&rsquo;s money in the mouth of his sack."
15960,1327,1,Gen,44002,"&ldquo;Also put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money.&rdquo; So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
15961,1328,1,Gen,44003,"As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys."
15962,1329,1,Gen,44004,"When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, &ldquo;Get up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, &lsquo;Why have you repaid evil for good?"
15963,1330,1,Gen,44005,"&lsquo;Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
15964,1331,1,Gen,44006,"So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words."
15965,1332,1,Gen,44007,"And they said to him, &ldquo;Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing."
15966,1333,1,Gen,44008,"&ldquo;Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord&rsquo;s house?"
15967,1334,1,Gen,44009,"&ldquo;With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord&rsquo;s slaves.&rdquo;"
15968,1335,1,Gen,44010,"And he said, &ldquo;Now also let it be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be blameless.&rdquo;"
15969,1336,1,Gen,44011,"Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack."
15970,1337,1,Gen,44012,"So he searched. He began with the oldest and left off with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin&rsquo;s sack."
15971,1338,1,Gen,44013,"Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city."
15972,1339,1,Gen,44014,"So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph&rsquo;s house, and he was still there; and they fell before him on the ground."
15973,1340,1,Gen,44015,"And Joseph said to them, &ldquo;What deed is this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?&rdquo;"
15974,1341,1,Gen,44016,"Then Judah said, &ldquo;What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; here we are, my lord&rsquo;s slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.&rdquo;"
15975,1342,1,Gen,44017,"But he said, &ldquo;Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.&rdquo;"
15976,1343,1,Gen,44018,"Then Judah came near to him and said: &ldquo;O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord&rsquo;s hearing, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even like Pharaoh."
15977,1344,1,Gen,44019,"&ldquo;My lord asked his servants, saying, &lsquo;Have you a father or a brother?&rsquo;"
15978,1345,1,Gen,44020,"&ldquo;And we said to my lord, &lsquo;We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, who is young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother&rsquo;s children, and his father loves him.&rsquo;"
15979,1346,1,Gen,44021,"&ldquo;Then you said to your servants, &lsquo;Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.&rsquo;"
15980,1347,1,Gen,44022,"&ldquo;And we said to my lord, &lsquo;The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.&rsquo;"
15981,1348,1,Gen,44023,"&ldquo;But you said to your servants, &lsquo;Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.&rsquo;"
15982,1349,1,Gen,44024,"&ldquo;So it was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord."
15983,1350,1,Gen,44025,"&ldquo;And our father said, &lsquo;Go back and buy us a little food.&rsquo;"
15984,1351,1,Gen,44026,"&ldquo;But we said, &lsquo;We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the man&rsquo;s face unless our youngest brother is with us.&rsquo;"
15985,1352,1,Gen,44027,"&ldquo;Then your servant my father said to us, &lsquo;You know that my wife bore me two sons;"
15986,1353,1,Gen,44028,"&lsquo;and the one went out from me, and I said, &ldquo;Surely he is torn to pieces&rdquo;; and I have not seen him since."
15987,1354,1,Gen,44029,"&lsquo;But if you take this one also from me, and calamity befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.&rsquo;"
15988,1355,1,Gen,44030,"&ldquo;Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad&rsquo;s life,"
15989,1356,1,Gen,44031,"&ldquo;it will happen, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
15990,1357,1,Gen,44032,"&ldquo;For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, &lsquo;If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father forever.&rsquo;"
15991,1358,1,Gen,44033,"&ldquo;Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers."
15992,1359,1,Gen,44034,"&ldquo;For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would come upon my father?&rdquo;"
15993,1360,1,Gen,45001,"Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, &ldquo;Make everyone go out from me!&rdquo; So no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers."
15994,1361,1,Gen,45002,"And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it."
15995,1362,1,Gen,45003,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;I am Joseph; does my father still live?&rdquo; But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed in his presence."
15996,1363,1,Gen,45004,"And Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;Please come near to me.&rdquo; So they came near. Then he said: &ldquo;I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
15997,1364,1,Gen,45005,"&ldquo;But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life."
15998,1365,1,Gen,45006,"&ldquo;For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting."
15999,1366,1,Gen,45007,"&ldquo;And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
16000,1367,1,Gen,45008,"&ldquo;So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
16001,1368,1,Gen,45009,"&ldquo;Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says your son Joseph: &ldquo;God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry."
16002,1369,1,Gen,45010,"&ldquo;You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children&rsquo;s children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have."
16003,1370,1,Gen,45011,"&ldquo;There I will provide for you, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty; for there are still five years of famine.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
16004,1371,1,Gen,45012,"&ldquo;And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you."
16005,1372,1,Gen,45013,"&ldquo;So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.&rdquo;"
16006,1373,1,Gen,45014,"Then he fell on his brother Benjamin&rsquo;s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."
16007,1374,1,Gen,45015,"Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him."
16008,1375,1,Gen,45016,"Now the report of it was heard in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house, saying, &ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s brothers have come.&rdquo; So it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well."

16075,1442,1,Gen,47021,"And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end."
16076,1443,1,Gen,47022,"Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had rations allotted to them by Pharaoh, and they ate their rations which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands."

16085,1452,1,Gen,47031,"Then he said, &ldquo;Swear to me.&rdquo; And he swore to him. So Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed."
16086,1453,1,Gen,48001,"Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, &ldquo;Indeed your father is sick&rdquo;; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
16087,1454,1,Gen,48002,"And Jacob was told, &ldquo;Look, your son Joseph is coming to you&rdquo;; and Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed."
16088,1455,1,Gen,48003,"Then Jacob said to Joseph: &ldquo;God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,"
16089,1456,1,Gen,48004,"&ldquo;and said to me, &lsquo;Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.&rsquo;"
16090,1457,1,Gen,48005,"&ldquo;And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
16091,1458,1,Gen,48006,"&ldquo;Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance."
16092,1459,1,Gen,48007,"&ldquo;But as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).&rdquo;"
16093,1460,1,Gen,48008,"Then Israel saw Joseph&rsquo;s sons, and said, &ldquo;Who are these?&rdquo;"
16094,1461,1,Gen,48009,"And Joseph said to his father, &ldquo;They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.&rdquo;"
16095,1462,1,Gen,48010,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. Then Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them."
16096,1463,1,Gen,48011,"And Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;I had not thought to see your face; but in fact, God has also shown me your offspring!&rdquo;"
16097,1464,1,Gen,48012,"So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth."
16098,1465,1,Gen,48013,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel&rsquo;s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel&rsquo;s right hand, and brought them near him."
16099,1466,1,Gen,48014,"Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim&rsquo;s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh&rsquo;s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn."
16100,1467,1,Gen,48015,"And he blessed Joseph, and said: &ldquo;God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has fed me all my life long to this day, "

16106,1645,1,Exod,5012,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
16107,1646,1,Exod,5013,"And the taskmasters forced them to hurry, saying, &ldquo;Fulfill your work, your daily quota, as when there was straw.&rdquo;"
16108,1647,1,Exod,5014,"Also the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, &ldquo;Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as before?&rdquo;"
16109,1648,1,Exod,5015,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;Why are you dealing thus with your servants?"
16110,1649,1,Exod,5016,"&ldquo;There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, &lsquo;Make brick!&rsquo; And indeed your servants are beaten, but the fault is in your own people.&rdquo;"

16112,1651,1,Exod,5018,"&ldquo;Therefore go now and work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the quota of bricks.&rdquo;"
16113,1652,1,Exod,5019,"And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble after it was said, &ldquo;You shall not reduce any bricks from your daily quota.&rdquo;"
16114,1653,1,Exod,5020,"Then, as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron who stood there to meet them."
16115,1654,1,Exod,5021,"And they said to them, &ldquo;Let the Lord look on you and judge, because you have made us abhorrent in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.&rdquo;"
16116,1655,1,Exod,5022,"So Moses returned to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Lord, why have You brought trouble on this people? Why is it You have sent me?"
16117,1656,1,Exod,5023,"&ldquo;For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered Your people at all.&rdquo;"
16118,1657,1,Exod,6001,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.&rdquo;"

16146,1685,1,Exod,6029,"that the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, &ldquo;I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.&rdquo;"
16147,1686,1,Exod,6030,"But Moses said before the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heed me?&rdquo;"
16148,1687,1,Exod,7001,"So the Lord said to Moses: &ldquo;See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet."
16149,1688,1,Exod,7002,"&ldquo;You shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land."

16153,1692,1,Exod,7006,"Then Moses and Aaron did so; just as the Lord commanded them, so they did."
16154,1693,1,Exod,7007,And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
16155,1694,1,Exod,7008,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
16156,1695,1,Exod,7009,"&ldquo;When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, &lsquo;Show a miracle for yourselves,&rsquo; then you shall say to Aaron, &lsquo;Take your rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16157,1696,1,Exod,7010,"So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the Lord commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
16158,1697,1,Exod,7011,"But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments."
16159,1698,1,Exod,7012,"For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron&rsquo;s rod swallowed up their rods."
16160,1699,1,Exod,7013,"And Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the Lord had said."
16161,1700,1,Exod,7014,"So the Lord said to Moses: &ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go."
16162,1701,1,Exod,7015,"&ldquo;Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the river&rsquo;s bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand."
16163,1702,1,Exod,7016,"&ldquo;And you shall say to him, &lsquo;The Lord God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, &ldquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness&rdquo;; but indeed, until now you would not hear!"

16166,1705,1,Exod,7019,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, &ldquo;Say to Aaron, &lsquo;Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be bloo"
16167,1706,1,Exod,7020,"And Moses and Aaron did so, just as the Lord commanded. So he lifted up the rod and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants. And all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood."
16168,1707,1,Exod,7021,"The fish that were in the river died, the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt."
16169,1708,1,Exod,7022,"Then the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; and Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the Lord had said."
16170,1709,1,Exod,7023,And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither was his heart moved by this.
16171,1710,1,Exod,7024,"So all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river."
16172,1711,1,Exod,7025,And seven days passed after the Lord had struck the river.
16173,1712,1,Exod,8001,"And the Lord spoke to Moses, &ldquo;Go to Pharaoh and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord: &ldquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me."

16177,1716,1,Exod,8005,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, &ldquo;Say to Aaron, &lsquo;Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16178,1717,1,Exod,8006,"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt."
16179,1718,1,Exod,8007,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt."
16180,1719,1,Exod,8008,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, &ldquo;Entreat the Lord that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the Lord.&rdquo;"
16181,1720,1,Exod,8009,"And Moses said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Accept the honor of saying when I shall intercede for you, for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only.&rdquo;"
16182,1721,1,Exod,8010,"So he said, &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Let it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the Lord our God."

16184,1723,1,Exod,8012,Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to the Lord concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.
16185,1724,1,Exod,8013,"So the Lord did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields."
16186,1725,1,Exod,8014,"They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank."
16187,1726,1,Exod,8015,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not heed them, as the Lord had said."
16188,1727,1,Exod,8016,"So the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Say to Aaron, &lsquo;Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16189,1728,1,Exod,8017,"And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
16190,1729,1,Exod,8018,"Now the magicians so worked with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. So there were lice on man and beast."

16192,7311,1,1Kg,6001,Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

16194,7313,1,1Kg,6003,"So they said, &ldquo;If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but by all means return it to Him with a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.&rdquo; "
16195,7314,1,1Kg,6004,"Then they said, &ldquo;What is the trespass offering which we shall return to Him?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Five golden tumors and five golden rats, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines. For the same plague was on all of you and on your lords. "
16196,7315,1,1Kg,6005,"Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land. "
16197,7316,1,1Kg,6006,"Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, did they not let the people go, that they might depart? "
16198,7317,1,1Kg,6007,"Now therefore, make a new cart, take two milk cows which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the cart; and take their calves home, away from them. "
16199,7318,1,1Kg,6008,"Then take the ark of the Lord and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go. "
16200,7319,1,1Kg,6009,"And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to Beth Shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that struck us &ndash; it happened to us by chance.&rdquo; "
16201,7320,1,1Kg,6010,"Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. "
16202,7321,1,1Kg,6011,"And they set the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors. "
16203,7322,1,1Kg,6012,"Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh. "
16204,7323,1,1Kg,6013,"Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. "
16205,7324,1,1Kg,6014,"Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone was there. So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. "
16206,7325,1,1Kg,6015,"The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the Lord. "
16207,7326,1,1Kg,6016,"So when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. "
16208,7327,1,1Kg,6017,"These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a trespass offering to the Lord: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron; "

"
16210,7329,1,1Kg,6019,"Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord. He struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people lamented because the Lord had struck the people with a great slaughter. "
16211,7330,1,1Kg,6020,"And the men of Beth Shemesh said, &ldquo;Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? And to whom shall it go up from us?&rdquo; "
16212,7331,1,1Kg,6021,"So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, &ldquo;The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord; come down and take it up with you.&rdquo; "
16213,7332,1,1Kg,7001,"Then the men of Kirjath Jearim came and took the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord. "
16214,7333,1,1Kg,7002,"So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord. "
16215,7334,1,1Kg,7003,"Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, &ldquo;If you return to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and prepare your hearts for the Lord, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo; "
16216,7335,1,1Kg,7004,"So the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only. "
16217,7336,1,1Kg,7005,"And Samuel said, &ldquo;Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lord for you.&rdquo; "
16218,7337,1,1Kg,7006,"So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured it out before the Lord. And they fasted that day, and said there, &ldquo;We have sinned against the Lord.&rdquo; And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah. "
16219,7338,1,1Kg,7007,"Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines. "
16220,7339,1,1Kg,7008,"So the children of Israel said to Samuel, &ldquo;Do not cease to cry out to the Lord our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo; "
16221,7340,1,1Kg,7009,"And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. Then Samuel cried out to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him. "
16222,7341,1,1Kg,7010,"Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the Lord thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel. "
16223,7342,1,1Kg,7011,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car. "
16224,7343,1,1Kg,7012,"Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, &ldquo;Thus far the Lord has helped us.&rdquo; "
16225,7344,1,1Kg,7013,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. "
16226,7345,1,1Kg,7014,"Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. "
16227,7346,1,1Kg,7015,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
16228,7347,1,1Kg,7016,"He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places. "
16229,7348,1,1Kg,7017,"But he always returned to Ramah, for his home was there. There he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to the Lord. "
16230,7349,1,1Kg,8001,Now it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel. 
16231,7350,1,1Kg,8002,"The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. "
16232,7351,1,1Kg,8003,"But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice. "
16233,7352,1,1Kg,8004,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, "
16234,7353,1,1Kg,8005,"and said to him, &ldquo;Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.&rdquo; "
16235,7354,1,1Kg,8006,"But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, &ldquo;Give us a king to judge us.&rdquo; So Samuel prayed to the Lord. "
16236,7355,1,1Kg,8007,"And the Lord said to Samuel, &ldquo;Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them. "
16237,7356,1,1Kg,8008,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day &ndash; with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods &ndash; so they are doing to you also. "

16239,7358,1,1Kg,8010,So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who asked him for a king. 
16240,7359,1,1Kg,8011,"And he said, &ldquo;This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots. "
16241,7360,1,1Kg,8012,"He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. "
16242,7361,1,1Kg,8013,"He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. "
16243,7362,1,1Kg,8014,"And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. "

16247,7366,1,1Kg,8018,"And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the Lord will not hear you in that day.&rdquo; "
16248,7367,1,1Kg,8019,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, &ldquo;No, but we will have a king over us, "

16279,499,1,Gen,20003,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, &ldquo;Indeed you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;"
16280,500,1,Gen,20004,"But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, &ldquo;Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also?"
16281,501,1,Gen,20005,"&ldquo;Did he not say to me, &lsquo;She is my sister&rsquo;? And she, even she herself said, &lsquo;He is my brother.&rsquo; In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.&rdquo;"
16282,502,1,Gen,20006,"And God said to him in a dream, &ldquo;Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her."
16283,503,1,Gen,20007,"&ldquo;Now therefore, restore the man&rsquo;s wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.&rdquo;"
16284,504,1,Gen,20008,"So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid."
16285,505,1,Gen,20009,"And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &ldquo;What have you done to us? How have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.&rdquo;"
16286,506,1,Gen,20010,"Then Abimelech said to Abraham, &ldquo;What did you have in view, that you have done this thing?&rdquo;"
16287,507,1,Gen,20011,"And Abraham said, &ldquo;Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife."
16288,508,1,Gen,20012,"&ldquo;But indeed she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
16289,509,1,Gen,20013,"&ldquo;And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father&rsquo;s house, that I said to her, &lsquo;This is your kindness that you should do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, &ldquo;He is my brother.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16290,510,1,Gen,20014,"Then Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him."
16291,511,1,Gen,20015,"And Abimelech said, &ldquo;See, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.&rdquo;"
16292,512,1,Gen,20016,"Then to Sarah he said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; indeed this vindicates youa before all who are with you and before everybody.&rdquo; Thus she was rebuked."
16293,513,1,Gen,20017,"So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they bore children;"
16294,514,1,Gen,20018,"for the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham&rsquo;s wife."
16295,515,1,Gen,21001,"And the Lord visited Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah as He had spoken."
16296,516,1,Gen,21002,"For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
16297,517,1,Gen,21003,"And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him &ndash; whom Sarah bore to him &ndash; Isaac."
16298,518,1,Gen,21004,"Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
16299,519,1,Gen,21005,Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
16300,520,1,Gen,21006,"And Sarah said, &ldquo;God has made me laugh, and all who hear will laugh with me.&rdquo;"
16301,521,1,Gen,21007,"She also said, &ldquo;Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.&rdquo;"
16302,522,1,Gen,21008,So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.
16303,523,1,Gen,21009,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, scoffing."
16304,524,1,Gen,21010,"Therefore she said to Abraham, &ldquo;Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, namely with Isaac.&rdquo;"
16305,525,1,Gen,21011,"And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham&rsquo;s sight because of his son."
16306,526,1,Gen,21012,"But God said to Abraham, &ldquo;Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because of the lad or because of your bondwoman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your seed shall be called."
16307,527,1,Gen,21013,"&ldquo;Yet I will also make a nation of the son of the bondwoman, because he is your seed.&rdquo;"
16308,528,1,Gen,21014,"So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba."
16309,529,1,Gen,21015,"And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs."
16310,530,1,Gen,21016,"Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, &ldquo;Let me not see the death of the boy.&rdquo; So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept."
16311,531,1,Gen,21017,"And God heard the voice of the lad. Then the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, &ldquo;What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is."
16312,532,1,Gen,21018,"&ldquo;Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.&rdquo;"
16313,533,1,Gen,21019,"Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink."
16314,534,1,Gen,21020,"So God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
16315,535,1,Gen,21021,"He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt."
16316,536,1,Gen,21022,"And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, &ldquo;God is with you in all that you do."
16317,537,1,Gen,21023,"&ldquo;Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have dwelt.&rdquo;"
16318,538,1,Gen,21024,"And Abraham said, &ldquo;I will swear.&rdquo;"
16319,539,1,Gen,21025,"Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech&rsquo;s servants had seized."
16320,540,1,Gen,21026,"And Abimelech said, &ldquo;I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.&rdquo;"
16321,541,1,Gen,21027,"So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant."
16322,542,1,Gen,21028,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
16323,543,1,Gen,21029,"Then Abimelech asked Abraham, &ldquo;What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?&rdquo;"
16324,544,1,Gen,21030,"And he said, &ldquo;You will take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they may be my witness that I have dug this well.&rdquo;"
16325,545,1,Gen,21031,"Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because the two of them swore an oath there."
16326,546,1,Gen,21032,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. So Abimelech rose with Phichol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines."
16327,547,1,Gen,21033,"Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God."
16328,548,1,Gen,21034,And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.
16329,549,1,Gen,22001,"Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, &ldquo;Abraham!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;"
16330,550,1,Gen,22002,"Then He said, &ldquo;Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&rdquo;"
16331,551,1,Gen,22003,"So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him."
16332,552,1,Gen,22004,Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off.
16333,553,1,Gen,22005,"And Abraham said to his young men, &ldquo;Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.&rdquo;"
16334,554,1,Gen,22006,"So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together."
16335,555,1,Gen,22007,"But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am, my son.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&rdquo;"
16336,556,1,Gen,22008,"And Abraham said, &ldquo;My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.&rdquo; So the two of them went together."
16337,557,1,Gen,22009,"Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood."
16338,558,1,Gen,22010,And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
16339,559,1,Gen,22011,"But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, &ldquo;Abraham, Abraham!&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;"
16340,560,1,Gen,22012,"And He said, &ldquo;Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.&rdquo;"
16341,561,1,Gen,22013,"Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son."
16342,562,1,Gen,22014,"And Abraham called the name of the place, The-Lord-Will-Provide; as it is said to this day, &ldquo;In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided.&rdquo;"
16343,563,1,Gen,22015,"Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,"
16344,564,1,Gen,22016,"and said: &ldquo;By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son &ndash; "

16349,9671,1,4Kg,9021,"Then Joram said, &ldquo;Make ready.&rdquo; And his chariot was made ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. "
16350,9672,1,4Kg,9022,"Now it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, &ldquo;Is it peace, Jehu?&rdquo; So he answered, &ldquo;What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many?&rdquo; "
16351,9673,1,4Kg,9023,"Then Joram turned around and fled, and said to Ahaziah, &ldquo;Treachery, Ahaziah!&rdquo; "

16355,9677,1,4Kg,9027,"But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he fled by the road to Beth Haggan. So Jehu pursued him, and said, &ldquo;Shoot him also in the chariot.&rdquo; And they shot him at the Ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there. "
16356,9678,1,4Kg,9028,"And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David. "

16361,9683,1,4Kg,9033,"Then he said, &ldquo;Throw her down.&rdquo; So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her underfoot. "
16362,9684,1,4Kg,9034,"And when he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, &ldquo;Go now, see to this accursed woman, and bury her, for she was a king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; "
16363,9685,1,4Kg,9035,"So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. "
16364,9686,1,4Kg,9036,"Therefore they came back and told him. And he said, &ldquo;This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, &lsquo;On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;"

16369,9691,1,4Kg,10004,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, &ldquo;Look, two kings could not stand up to him; how then can we stand?&rdquo; "
16370,9692,1,4Kg,10005,"And he who was in charge of the house, and he who was in charge of the city, the elders also, and those who reared the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, &ldquo;We are your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your sight.&rdquo; "
16371,9693,1,4Kg,10006,"Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying: If you are for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your master&rsquo;s sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the king&rsquo;s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them. "
16372,9694,1,4Kg,10007,"So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king&rsquo;s sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel. "

16375,9697,1,4Kg,10010,"Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the Lord has done what He spoke by His servant Elijah. "
16376,9698,1,4Kg,10011,"So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests, until he left him none remaining. "

16379,9701,1,4Kg,10014,"And he said, &ldquo;Take them alive!&rdquo; So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them. "
16380,9702,1,4Kg,10015,"Now when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, &ldquo;Is your heart right, as my heart is toward your heart?&rdquo; And Jehonadab answered, &ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Jehu said, &ldquo;If it is, give me your hand.&rdquo; So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.

16381,9703,1,4Kg,10016,"Then he said, &ldquo;Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord.&rdquo; So they had him ride in his chariot. "
16382,9704,1,4Kg,10017,"And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke to Elijah. "
16383,9705,1,4Kg,10018,"Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, &ldquo;Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu will serve him much. "

16385,9707,1,4Kg,10020,"And Jehu said, &ldquo;Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.&rdquo; So they proclaimed it. "
16386,9708,1,4Kg,10021,"Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was full from one end to the other. "

16390,9712,1,4Kg,10025,"Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, &ldquo;Go in and kill them; let no one come out!&rdquo; And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the guards and the officers threw them out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.

16407,9729,1,4Kg,11006,"one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts. You shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down. "
16408,9730,1,4Kg,11007,The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord for the king. 
16409,9731,1,4Kg,11008,"But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.&rdquo; "
16410,9732,1,4Kg,11009,"So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. "
16411,9733,1,4Kg,11010,"And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of the Lord. "
16412,9734,1,4Kg,11011,"Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house. "
16413,9735,1,4Kg,11012,"And he brought out the king&rsquo;s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; "
16414,9736,1,4Kg,11013,"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people, she came to the people in the temple of the Lord. "
16415,9737,1,4Kg,11014,"When she looked, there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, &ldquo;Treason! Treason!&rdquo; "
16416,10015,1,4Kg,21002,"And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel. "
16417,12571,1,Esth,4011,"All the king&rsquo;s servants and the people of the king&rsquo;s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been called, he has but one law: put all to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days. "
16418,12572,1,Esth,4012,"So they told Mordecai Esther&rsquo;s words. "
16419,12573,1,Esth,4013,"And Mordecai told them to answer Esther: &ldquo;Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king&rsquo;s palace any more than all the other Jews. "
16420,12574,1,Esth,4014,"For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&rsquo;s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&rdquo; "
16421,12575,1,Esth,4015,Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai: 
16422,12576,1,Esth,4016,"Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish! "
16423,12577,1,Esth,4017,So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.
16424,12578,1,Esth,5001,"Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king&rsquo;s palace, across from the king&rsquo;s house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house.* "
16425,12579,1,Esth,5002,"So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter. "
16426,12580,1,Esth,5003,"And the king said to her, &ldquo;What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given to you &ndash; up to half the kingdom!&rdquo; "
16427,12581,1,Esth,5004,"So Esther answered, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.&rdquo; "
16428,12582,1,Esth,5005,"Then the king said, &ldquo;Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.&rdquo; So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. "
16429,12583,1,Esth,5006,"At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, &ldquo;What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&rdquo; "
16430,12584,1,Esth,5007,"Then Esther answered and said, &ldquo;My petition and request is this: "
16431,12585,1,Esth,5008,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&rdquo; "
16432,12586,1,Esth,5009,"So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&rsquo;s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai. "
16433,12587,1,Esth,5010,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh. "
16434,12588,1,Esth,5011,"Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king. "
16435,12589,1,Esth,5012,"Moreover Haman said, &ldquo;Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king. "
16436,12590,1,Esth,5013,"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&rsquo;s gate.&rdquo; "
16437,12591,1,Esth,5014,"Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &ldquo;Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.&rdquo; And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made. "
16438,12592,1,Esth,6001,"That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. "
16439,12593,1,Esth,6002,"And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&rsquo;s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. "
16440,12594,1,Esth,6003,"Then the king said, &ldquo;What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&rdquo; And the king&rsquo;s servants who attended him said, &ldquo;Nothing has been done for him.&rdquo; "
16441,12595,1,Esth,6004,"So the king said, &ldquo;Who is in the court?&rdquo; Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king&rsquo;s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. "
16442,12596,1,Esth,6005,"The king&rsquo;s servants said to him, &ldquo;Haman is there, standing in the court.&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;Let him come in.&rdquo; "
16443,12597,1,Esth,6006,"So Haman came in, and the king asked him, &ldquo;What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?&rdquo; Now Haman thought in his heart, &ldquo;Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?&rdquo; "
16444,12598,1,Esth,6007,"And Haman answered the king, &ldquo;For the man whom the king delights to honor, "
16445,12599,1,Esth,6008,"let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, which has a royal crest placed on its head. "
16446,12600,1,Esth,6009,"Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&rsquo;s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: &lsquo;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&rsquo; &ldquo; "
16447,12601,1,Esth,6010,"Then the king said to Haman, &ldquo;Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king&rsquo;s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.&rdquo; "
16448,12602,1,Esth,6011,"So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, &ldquo;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&rdquo; "
16449,12603,1,Esth,6012,"Afterward Mordecai went back to the king&rsquo;s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. "
16450,12604,1,Esth,6013,"When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, &ldquo;If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.&rdquo; "
16451,12605,1,Esth,6014,"While they were still talking with him, the king&rsquo;s eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared. "
16452,12606,1,Esth,7001,So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. 
16453,12607,1,Esth,7002,"And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, &ldquo;What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&rdquo; "
16454,12608,1,Esth,7003,"Then Queen Esther answered and said, &ldquo;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. "
16455,12609,1,Esth,7004,"For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo; "
16456,12610,1,Esth,7005,"So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, &ldquo;Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?&rdquo; "
16457,12611,1,Esth,7006,"And Esther said, &ldquo;The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman!&rdquo; So Haman was terrified before the king and queen. "
16458,12612,1,Esth,7007,"Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. "
16459,12613,1,Esth,7008,"When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, &ldquo;Will he also assault the queen while I am in the house?&rdquo; As the word left the king&rsquo;s mouth, they covered Haman&rsquo;s face. "
16460,12614,1,Esth,7009,"Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, &ldquo;Look! The gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king&rsquo;s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.&rdquo; Then the king said, &ldquo;Hang him on it!&rdquo; "
16461,12615,1,Esth,7010,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king&rsquo;s wrath subsided. "
16462,12616,1,Esth,8001,"On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her. "
16463,12617,1,Esth,8002,"So the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman. "
16464,12618,1,Esth,8003,"Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews. "
16465,12619,1,Esth,8004,"And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king, "
16466,12620,1,Esth,8005,"and said, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king&rsquo;s provinces. "
16467,12621,1,Esth,8006,"For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?&rdquo; "
16468,12622,1,Esth,8007,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, &ldquo;Indeed, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews. "
16469,12623,1,Esth,8008,"You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews, as you please, in the king&rsquo;s name, and seal it with the king&rsquo;s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king&rsquo;s name and sealed with the king&rsquo;s signet ring no one can revoke.&rdquo; "
16470,12624,1,Esth,8009,"So the king&rsquo;s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all, to every province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. "
16471,12625,1,Esth,8010,"And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king&rsquo;s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses bred from swift steeds."
16472,12626,1,Esth,8011,"By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and protect their lives &ndash; to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, both little children and women, and to plunder their possessions, "
16473,12627,1,Esth,8012,"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. "
16474,12628,1,Esth,8013,"A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. "
16475,12629,1,Esth,8014,"The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king&rsquo;s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel. "
16476,12630,1,Esth,8015,"So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. "
16477,12631,1,Esth,8016,"The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor. "
16478,12632,1,Esth,8017,"And in every province and city, wherever the king&rsquo;s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday. Then many of the people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them. "
16479,12633,1,Esth,9001,"Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, the time came for the king&rsquo;s command and his decree to be executed. On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them. "
16480,12634,1,Esth,9002,"The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all people. "
16481,12635,1,Esth,9003,"And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king&rsquo;s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. "
16482,12636,1,Esth,9004,"For Mordecai was great in the king&rsquo;s palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent. "
16483,12637,1,Esth,9005,"Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them. "
16484,12638,1,Esth,9006,And in Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
16485,12639,1,Esth,9007,"Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, "
16486,12640,1,Esth,9008,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, "
16487,12641,1,Esth,9009,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha &ndash; "
16488,12642,1,Esth,9010,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews &ndash; they killed; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. "
16489,12643,1,Esth,9011,On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel was brought to the king. 
16490,12644,1,Esth,9012,"And the king said to Queen Esther, &ldquo;The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king&rsquo;s provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what is your further request? It shall be done.&rdquo; "
16491,12645,1,Esth,9013,"Then Esther said, &ldquo;If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today&rsquo;s decree, and let Haman&rsquo;s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.&rdquo; "
16492,12646,1,Esth,9014,"So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman&rsquo;s ten sons. "
16493,12647,1,Esth,9015,"And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. "
16494,12648,1,Esth,9016,"The remainder of the Jews in the king&rsquo;s provinces gathered together and protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. "
16495,12649,1,Esth,9017,This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth day of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
16496,12650,1,Esth,9018,"But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. "
16497,12651,1,Esth,9019,"Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar with gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and for sending presents to one another. "
16498,12652,1,Esth,9020,"And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, "
16499,12653,1,Esth,9021,"to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, "
16500,12654,1,Esth,9022,"as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor. "
16501,12655,1,Esth,9023,"So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them, "
16502,1730,1,Exod,8019,"Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;This is the finger of God.&rdquo; But Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, just as the Lord had said."
16503,1731,1,Exod,8020,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water. Then say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord: &ldquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
16504,1732,1,Exod,8021,"&ldquo;Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand."
16505,1733,1,Exod,8022,"&ldquo;And in that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, in order that you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of the land."
16506,1734,1,Exod,8023,"&ldquo;I will make a difference between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall be.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16507,1735,1,Exod,8024,"And the Lord did so. Thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh, into his servants&rsquo; houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies."
16508,1736,1,Exod,8025,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, &ldquo;Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.&rdquo;"
16509,1737,1,Exod,8026,"And Moses said, &ldquo;It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us?"
16510,1738,1,Exod,8027,"&ldquo;We will go three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God as He will command us.&rdquo;"
16511,1739,1,Exod,8028,"So Pharaoh said, &ldquo;I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Intercede for me.&rdquo;"
16512,1740,1,Exod,8029,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat the Lord, that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to "
16513,1741,1,Exod,8030,So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
16514,1742,1,Exod,8031,"And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained."
16515,1743,1,Exod,8032,"But Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go."
16516,1744,1,Exod,9001,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go in to Pharaoh and tell him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: &ldquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me."

16518,1746,1,Exod,9003,"&ldquo;behold, the hand of the Lord will be on your cattle in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep &ndash; a very severe pestilence."
16519,1747,1,Exod,9004,"&ldquo;And the Lord will make a difference between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt. So nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16520,1748,1,Exod,9005,"Then the Lord appointed a set time, saying, &ldquo;Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.&rdquo;"
16521,1749,1,Exod,9006,"So the Lord did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died."
16522,1750,1,Exod,9007,"Then Pharaoh sent, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh became hard, and he did not let the people go."
16523,1751,1,Exod,9008,"So the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, &ldquo;Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh."
16524,1752,1,Exod,9009,"&ldquo;And it will become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it will cause boils that break out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.&rdquo;"
16525,1753,1,Exod,9010,"Then they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses scattered them toward heaven. And they caused boils that break out in sores on man and beast."
16526,1754,1,Exod,9011,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians."
16527,1755,1,Exod,9012,"But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh; and he did not heed them, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses."
16528,1756,1,Exod,9013,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: &ldquo;Let My people go, that they may serve Me,"
16529,1757,1,Exod,9014,"&ldquo;for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart, and on your servants and on your people, that you may know that there is none like Me in all the earth."
16530,1758,1,Exod,9015,"&ldquo;Now if I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth."
16531,1759,1,Exod,9016,"&ldquo;But indeed for this purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth."
16532,1760,1,Exod,9017,"&ldquo;As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go."
16533,1761,1,Exod,9018,"&ldquo;Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now."
16534,1762,1,Exod,9019,"&ldquo;Therefore send now and gather your livestock and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down on every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought home; and they shall die.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16535,1763,1,Exod,9020,He who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee to the houses.
16536,1764,1,Exod,9021,But he who did not regard the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field.
16537,1765,1,Exod,9022,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt &ndash; on man, on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.&rdquo;"
16538,1766,1,Exod,9023,"And Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire darted to the ground. And the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt."
16539,1767,1,Exod,9024,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
16540,1768,1,Exod,9025,"And the hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail struck every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field."
16541,1769,1,Exod,9026,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail."
16542,1770,1,Exod,9027,"And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, &ldquo;I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous, and my people and I are wicked."
16543,1771,1,Exod,9028,"&ldquo;Entreat the Lord, that there may be no more mighty thundering and hail, for it is enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.&rdquo;"
16544,1772,1,Exod,9029,"So Moses said to him, &ldquo;As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, that you may know that the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s."
16545,1773,1,Exod,9030,"&ldquo;But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the Lord God.&rdquo;"
16546,1774,1,Exod,9031,"Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud."
16547,1775,1,Exod,9032,"But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are late crops."
16548,1776,1,Exod,9033,"So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to the Lord; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth."
16549,1777,1,Exod,9034,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants."
16550,1778,1,Exod,9035,"So the heart of Pharaoh was hard; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had spoken by Moses."
16551,1779,1,Exod,10001,"Now the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants, that I may show these signs of Mine before him,"
16552,1780,1,Exod,10002,"&ldquo;and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and your son&rsquo;s son the mighty things I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;"
16553,1781,1,Exod,10003,"So Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: &lsquo;How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
16554,1782,1,Exod,10004,"&lsquo;Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory."
16555,1783,1,Exod,10005,"&lsquo;And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field."
16556,1784,1,Exod,10006,"&lsquo;They shall fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians &ndash; which neither your fathers nor your fathers&rsquo; fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.&rsquo;&rdquo; And he turned and went out from Ph"
16557,1785,1,Exod,10007,"Then Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants said to him, &ldquo;How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?&rdquo;"
16558,1786,1,Exod,10008,"So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, &ldquo;Go, serve the Lord your God. Who are the ones that are going?&rdquo;"
16559,1787,1,Exod,10009,"And Moses said, &ldquo;We will go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for we must hold a feast to the Lord.&rdquo;"
16560,1788,1,Exod,10010,"Then he said to them, &ldquo;The Lord had better be with you when I let you and your little ones go! Beware, for evil is ahead of you."
16561,1789,1,Exod,10011,"&ldquo;Not so! Go now, you who are men, and serve the Lord, for that is what you desired.&rdquo; And they were driven out from Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence."
16562,1790,1,Exod,10012,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land &ndash; all that the hail has left.&rdquo;"
16563,1791,1,Exod,10013,"So Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts."
16564,1792,1,Exod,10014,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. They were very severe; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them."
16565,1793,1,Exod,10015,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. So there remained nothing green on the trees or on the plants of the field throughout "
16566,1794,1,Exod,10016,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, &ldquo;I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you."
16567,1795,1,Exod,10017,"&ldquo;Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that He may take away from me this death only.&rdquo;"
16568,1796,1,Exod,10018,So he went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
16569,1797,1,Exod,10019,"And the Lord turned a very strong west wind, which took the locusts away and blew them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the territory of Egypt."
16570,1798,1,Exod,10020,"But the Lord hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go."
16571,1799,1,Exod,10021,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, darkness which may even be felt.&rdquo;"
16572,1800,1,Exod,10022,"So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days."
16573,1801,1,Exod,10023,"They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
16574,1802,1,Exod,10024,"Then Pharaoh called to Moses and said, &ldquo;Go, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back. Let your little ones also go with you.&rdquo;"
16575,1803,1,Exod,10025,"But Moses said, &ldquo;You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God."
16576,1804,1,Exod,10026,"&ldquo;Our livestock also shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind. For we must take some of them to serve the Lord our God, and even we do not know with what we must serve the Lord until we arrive there.&rdquo;"
16577,1805,1,Exod,10027,"But the Lord hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and he would not let them go."
16578,1806,1,Exod,10028,"Then Pharaoh said to him, &ldquo;Get away from me! Take heed to yourself and see my face no more! For in the day you see my face you shall die!&rdquo;"
16579,1807,1,Exod,10029,"So Moses said, &ldquo;You have spoken well. I will never see your face again.&rdquo;"
16580,1808,1,Exod,11001,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out of here altogether."
16581,1809,1,Exod,11002,"&ldquo;Speak now in the hearing of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor, articles of silver and articles of gold.&rdquo;"
16582,1810,1,Exod,11003,"And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants and in the sight of the people."
16583,1811,1,Exod,11004,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt;"
16584,1812,1,Exod,11005,"&lsquo;and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the animals."
16585,1813,1,Exod,11006,"&lsquo;Then there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was not like it before, nor shall be like it again."
16586,1814,1,Exod,11007,"&lsquo;But against none of the children of Israel shall a dog move its tongue, against man or beast, that you may know that the Lord does make a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.&rsquo;"
16587,1815,1,Exod,11008,"&ldquo;And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, &lsquo;Get out, and all the people who follow you!&rsquo; After that I will go out.&rdquo; Then he went out from Pharaoh in great anger."
16588,1816,1,Exod,11009,"But the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Pharaoh will not heed you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.&rdquo;"
16589,1817,1,Exod,11010,"So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land."
16590,1818,1,Exod,12001,"Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
16591,1819,1,Exod,12002,"&ldquo;This month shall be your beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you."
16592,1820,1,Exod,12003,"&ldquo;Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: &lsquo;On the tenth of this month every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the house of his father, a lamb for a household."
16593,1821,1,Exod,12004,"&lsquo;And if the household is too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the persons; according to each man&rsquo;s need you shall make your count for the lamb."
16594,1822,1,Exod,12005,"&lsquo;Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats."
16595,1823,1,Exod,12006,"&lsquo;Now you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at twilight."
16596,1824,1,Exod,12007,"&lsquo;And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat it."
16597,1825,1,Exod,12008,"&lsquo;Then they shall eat the flesh on that night; roasted in fire, with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it."
16598,1826,1,Exod,12009,"&lsquo;Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted in fire &ndash; its head with its legs and its entrails."
16599,1827,1,Exod,12010,"&lsquo;You shall let none of it remain until morning, and what remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire."
16600,1828,1,Exod,12011,"&lsquo;And thus you shall eat it: with a belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. So you shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord&rsquo;s Passover."
16601,1829,1,Exod,12012,"&lsquo;For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord."
16602,1830,1,Exod,12013,"&lsquo;Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt."
16603,1831,1,Exod,12014,"&lsquo;So this day shall be to you a memorial; and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord throughout your generations. You shall keep it as a feast by an everlasting ordinance."
16604,1832,1,Exod,12015,"&lsquo;Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel."
16605,1833,1,Exod,12016,"&lsquo;On the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you. No manner of work shall be done on them; but that which everyone must eat &ndash; that only may be prepared by you."
16606,1834,1,Exod,12017,"&lsquo;So you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this same day I will have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as an everlasting ordinance."
16607,1835,1,Exod,12018,"&lsquo;In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening."
16608,1836,1,Exod,12019,"&lsquo;For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses, since whoever eats what is leavened, that same person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a stranger or a native of the land."
16609,1837,1,Exod,12020,"&lsquo;You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16610,1838,1,Exod,12021,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, &ldquo;Pick out and take lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover lamb."
16611,1839,1,Exod,12022,"&ldquo;And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning."
16612,1840,1,Exod,12023,"&ldquo;For the Lord will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over the door and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you."
16613,1841,1,Exod,12024,"&ldquo;And you shall observe this thing as an ordinance for you and your sons forever."
16614,1842,1,Exod,12025,"&ldquo;It will come to pass when you come to the land which the Lord will give you, just as He promised, that you shall keep this service."
16615,1843,1,Exod,12026,"&ldquo;And it shall be, when your children say to you, &lsquo;What do you mean by this service?&rsquo;"
16616,1844,1,Exod,12027,"&ldquo;that you shall say, &lsquo;It is the Passover sacrifice of the Lord, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and delivered our households.&rsquo;&rdquo; So the people bowed their heads and worshiped."
16617,1845,1,Exod,12028,"Then the children of Israel went away and did so; just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did."
16618,1846,1,Exod,12029,"And it came to pass at midnight that the Lord struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of livestock."
16619,1847,1,Exod,12030,"So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
16620,1848,1,Exod,12031,"Then he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, &ldquo;Rise, go out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel. And go, serve the Lord as you have said."
16621,1849,1,Exod,12032,"&ldquo;Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.&rdquo;"
16622,1850,1,Exod,12033,"And the Egyptians urged the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste. For they said, &ldquo;We shall all be dead.&rdquo;"
16623,1851,1,Exod,12034,"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders."
16624,1852,1,Exod,12035,"Now the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they had asked from the Egyptians articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing."
16625,1853,1,Exod,12036,"And the Lord had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they granted them what they requested. Thus they plundered the Egyptians."
16626,1854,1,Exod,12037,"Then the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children."
16627,1855,1,Exod,12038,"A mixed multitude went up with them also, and flocks and herds &ndash; a great deal of livestock."
16628,1856,1,Exod,12039,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves."
16629,1857,1,Exod,12040,Now the sojourn of the children of Israel who lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
16630,1858,1,Exod,12041,"And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years &ndash; on that very same day &ndash; it came to pass that all the armies of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt."
16631,1859,1,Exod,12042,"It is a night of solemn observance to the Lord for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This is that night of the Lord, a solemn observance for all the children of Israel throughout their generations."
16632,1860,1,Exod,12043,"And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, &ldquo;This is the ordinance of the Passover: No foreigner shall eat it."
16633,1861,1,Exod,12044,"&ldquo;But every man&rsquo;s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he may eat it."
16634,1862,1,Exod,12045,"&ldquo;A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat it."
16635,1863,1,Exod,12046,"&ldquo;In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break one of its bones."
16636,1864,1,Exod,12047,"&ldquo;All the congregation of Israel shall keep it."
16637,1865,1,Exod,12048,"&ldquo;And when a stranger dwells with you and wants to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it."
16638,1866,1,Exod,12049,"&ldquo;One law shall be for the native-born and for the stranger who dwells among you.&rdquo;"
16639,1867,1,Exod,12050,"Thus all the children of Israel did; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did."
16640,1868,1,Exod,12051,"And it came to pass, on that very same day, that the Lord brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their armies."
16641,1869,1,Exod,13001,"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,"
16642,1870,1,Exod,13002,"&ldquo;Consecrate to Me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast; it is Mine.&rdquo;"
16643,1871,1,Exod,13003,"And Moses said to the people: &ldquo;Remember this day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out of this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten."
16644,1872,1,Exod,13004,"&ldquo;On this day you are going out, in the month Abib."
16645,1873,1,Exod,13005,"&ldquo;And it shall be, when the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this servic"
16646,1874,1,Exod,13006,"&ldquo;Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the Lord."
16647,1875,1,Exod,13007,"&ldquo;Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And no leavened bread shall be seen among you, nor shall leaven be seen among you in all your quarters."
16648,1876,1,Exod,13008,"&ldquo;And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, &lsquo;This is done because of what the Lord did for me when I came up from Egypt.&rsquo;"
16649,1877,1,Exod,13009,"&ldquo;It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the Lord&rsquo;s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the Lord has brought you out of Egypt."
16650,1878,1,Exod,13010,"&ldquo;You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year."
16651,1879,1,Exod,13011,"&ldquo;And it shall be, when the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,"
16652,1880,1,Exod,13012,"&ldquo;that you shall set apart to the Lord all that open the womb, that is, every firstborn that comes from an animal which you have; the males shall be the Lord&rsquo;s."
16653,1881,1,Exod,13013,"&ldquo;But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem."
16654,1882,1,Exod,13014,"&ldquo;So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; that you shall say to him, &lsquo;By strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
16655,1883,1,Exod,13015,"&lsquo;And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the Lord killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all males that open the womb, but all"
16656,1884,1,Exod,13016,"&ldquo;It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt.&rdquo;"
16657,1885,1,Exod,13017,"Then it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, &ldquo;Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.&rdquo;"
16658,1886,1,Exod,13018,So God led the people around by way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up in orderly ranks out of the land of Egypt.
16659,1887,1,Exod,13019,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had placed the children of Israel under solemn oath, saying, &ldquo;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here with you.&rdquo;"
16660,1888,1,Exod,13020,So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness.
16661,1889,1,Exod,13021,"And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night."
16662,1890,1,Exod,13022,He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
16663,1891,1,Exod,14001,"Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:"
16664,1892,1,Exod,14002,"&ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before it by the sea."
16665,1893,1,Exod,14003,"&ldquo;For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, &lsquo;They are bewildered by the land; the wilderness has closed them in.&rsquo;"
16666,1894,1,Exod,14004,"&ldquo;Then I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord.&rdquo; And they did so."
16667,1895,1,Exod,14005,"Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, &ldquo;Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?&rdquo;"
16668,1896,1,Exod,14006,So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him.
16669,1897,1,Exod,14007,"Also, he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them."
16670,1898,1,Exod,14008,"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with boldness."
16671,1899,1,Exod,14009,"So the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon."
16672,1900,1,Exod,14010,"And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord."
16673,1901,1,Exod,14011,"Then they said to Moses, &ldquo;Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt?"
16674,1902,1,Exod,14012,"&ldquo;Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, &lsquo;Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians&rsquo;? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.&rdquo;"
16675,1903,1,Exod,14013,"And Moses said to the people, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever."
16676,1904,1,Exod,14014,"&ldquo;The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.&rdquo;"
16677,1905,1,Exod,14015,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward."
16678,1906,1,Exod,14016,"&ldquo;But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea."
16679,1907,1,Exod,14017,"&ldquo;And I indeed will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. So I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen."
16680,1908,1,Exod,14018,"&ldquo;Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.&rdquo;"
16681,1909,1,Exod,14019,"And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them."
16682,1910,1,Exod,14020,"So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness to the one, and it gave light by night to the other, so that the one did not come near the other all that night."
16683,1911,1,Exod,14021,"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided."
16684,1912,1,Exod,14022,"So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
16685,1913,1,Exod,14023,"And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
16686,1914,1,Exod,14024,"Now it came to pass, in the morning watch, that the Lord looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He troubled the army of the Egyptians."
16687,1915,1,Exod,14025,"And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, &ldquo;Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians.&rdquo;"
16688,1916,1,Exod,14026,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.&rdquo;"
16689,1917,1,Exod,14027,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
16690,1918,1,Exod,14028,"Then the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained."
16691,1919,1,Exod,14029,"But the children of Israel had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
16692,1920,1,Exod,14030,"So the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore."
16693,1921,1,Exod,14031,"Thus Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done in Egypt; so the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and His servant Moses."
16694,1922,1,Exod,15001,"Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and spoke, saying: &ldquo;I will sing to the Lord, For He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!"
16695,1923,1,Exod,15002,"The Lord is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; He is my God, and I will praise Him; My father&rsquo;s God, and I will exalt Him."
16696,1924,1,Exod,15003,"The Lord is a man of war; The Lord is His name."
16697,1925,1,Exod,15004,"Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea. "
16698,1926,1,Exod,15005,"The depths have covered them; They sank to the bottom like a stone."
16699,1927,1,Exod,15006,"&ldquo;Your right hand, O Lord, has become glorious in power; Your right hand, O Lord, has dashed the enemy in pieces."
16700,1928,1,Exod,15007,"And in the greatness of Your excellence You have overthrown those who rose against You; You sent forth Your wrath; It consumed them like stubble."
16701,1929,1,Exod,15008,"And with the blast of Your nostrils The waters were gathered together; The floods stood upright like a heap; The depths congealed in the heart of the sea."
16702,1930,1,Exod,15009,"The enemy said, &lsquo;I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, My hand shall destroy them.&rsquo;"
16703,1931,1,Exod,15010,"You blew with Your wind, The sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters."
16704,1932,1,Exod,15011,"&ldquo;Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders? "
16705,1933,1,Exod,15012,"You stretched out Your right hand; The earth swallowed them."
16706,1934,1,Exod,15013,"You in Your mercy have led forth The people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength To Your holy habitation."
16707,1935,1,Exod,15014,"&ldquo;The people will hear and be afraid; Sorrow will take hold of the inhabitants of Philistia."
16708,1936,1,Exod,15015,"Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, Trembling will take hold of them; All the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away."
16709,1937,1,Exod,15016,"Fear and dread will fall on them; By the greatness of Your arm They will be as still as a stone, Till Your people pass over, O Lord, Till the people pass over Whom You have purchased."
16710,1938,1,Exod,15017,"You will bring them in and plant them In the mountain of Your inheritance, In the place, O Lord, which You have made For Your own dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established."
16711,1939,1,Exod,15018,"&ldquo;The Lord shall reign forever and ever.&rdquo;"
16712,1940,1,Exod,15019,"For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea."
16713,1941,1,Exod,15020,"Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances."
16714,1942,1,Exod,15021,"And Miriam answered them: &ldquo;Sing to the Lord, For He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!&rdquo;"
16715,1943,1,Exod,15022,"So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea; then they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water."
16716,1944,1,Exod,15023,"Now when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah."
16717,1945,1,Exod,15024,"And the people complained against Moses, saying, &ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo;"
16718,1946,1,Exod,15025,"So he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them,"
16719,1947,1,Exod,15026,"and said, &ldquo;If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you."
16720,1948,1,Exod,15027,"Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters."
16721,1949,1,Exod,16001,"And they journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt."
16722,1950,1,Exod,16002,Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
16723,1951,1,Exod,16003,"And the children of Israel said to them, &ldquo;Oh, that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly wi"
16724,1952,1,Exod,16004,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not."
16725,1953,1,Exod,16005,"&ldquo;And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.&rdquo;"
16726,1954,1,Exod,16006,"Then Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, &ldquo;At evening you shall know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt."
16727,1955,1,Exod,16007,"&ldquo;And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord; for He hears your complaints against the Lord. But what are we, that you complain against us?&rdquo;"
16728,1956,1,Exod,16008,"Also Moses said, &ldquo;This shall be seen when the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; for the Lord hears your complaints which you make against Him. And what are we? Your complaints are not against us but against t"
16729,1957,1,Exod,16009,"Then Moses spoke to Aaron, &ldquo;Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, &lsquo;Come near before the Lord, for He has heard your complaints.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16730,1958,1,Exod,16010,"Now it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud."
16731,1959,1,Exod,16011,"And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,"
16732,1960,1,Exod,16012,"&ldquo;I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, &lsquo;At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I am the Lord your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16733,1961,1,Exod,16013,"So it was that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around the camp."
16734,1962,1,Exod,16014,"And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, as fine as frost on the ground."
16735,1963,1,Exod,16015,"So when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, &ldquo;This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat."
16736,1964,1,Exod,16016,"&ldquo;This is the thing which the Lord has commanded: &lsquo;Let every man gather it according to each one&rsquo;s need, one omer for each person, according to the number of persons; let every man take for those who are in his tent.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16737,1965,1,Exod,16017,"Then the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less."
16738,1966,1,Exod,16018,"So when they measured it by omers, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack. Every man had gathered according to each one&rsquo;s need."
16739,1967,1,Exod,16019,"And Moses said, &ldquo;Let no one leave any of it till morning.&rdquo;"
16740,1968,1,Exod,16020,"Notwithstanding they did not heed Moses. But some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them."
16741,1969,1,Exod,16021,"So they gathered it every morning, every man according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it melted."
16742,1970,1,Exod,16022,"And so it was, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
16743,1971,1,Exod,16023,"Then he said to them, &ldquo;This is what the Lord has said: &lsquo;Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16744,1972,1,Exod,16024,"So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it."
16745,1973,1,Exod,16025,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field."
16746,1974,1,Exod,16026,"&ldquo;Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.&rdquo;"
16747,1975,1,Exod,16027,"Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none."
16748,1976,1,Exod,16028,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?"
16749,1977,1,Exod,16029,"&ldquo;See! For the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.&rdquo;"
16750,1978,1,Exod,16030,So the people rested on the seventh day.
16751,1979,1,Exod,16031,"And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And it was like white coriander seed, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey."
16752,1980,1,Exod,16032,"Then Moses said, &ldquo;This is the thing which the Lord has commanded: &lsquo;Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16753,1981,1,Exod,16033,"And Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations.&rdquo;"
16754,1982,1,Exod,16034,"As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
16755,1983,1,Exod,16035,"And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan."
16756,1984,1,Exod,16036,Now an omer is one-tenth of an ephah.
16757,1985,1,Exod,17001,"Then all the congregation of the children of Israel set out on their journey from the Wilderness of Sin, according to the commandment of the Lord, and camped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink."
16758,1986,1,Exod,17002,"Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, &ldquo;Give us water, that we may drink.&rdquo; So Moses said to them, &ldquo;Why do you contend with me? Why do you tempt the Lord?&rdquo;"
16759,1987,1,Exod,17003,"And the people thirsted there for water, and the people complained against Moses, and said, &ldquo;Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?&rdquo;"
16760,1988,1,Exod,17004,"So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me!&rdquo;"
16761,1989,1,Exod,17005,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel. Also take in your hand your rod with which you struck the river, and go."
16762,1990,1,Exod,17006,"&ldquo;Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.&rdquo; And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
16763,1991,1,Exod,17007,"So he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Is the Lord among us or not?&rdquo;"
16764,1992,1,Exod,17008,Now Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
16765,1993,1,Exod,17009,"And Moses said to Joshua, &ldquo;Choose us some men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.&rdquo;"
16766,2080,1,Exod,21002,"&ldquo;If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free and pay nothing."
16767,2081,1,Exod,21003,"&ldquo;If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him."
16768,2082,1,Exod,21004,"&ldquo;If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master&rsquo;s, and he shall go out by himself."
16769,2083,1,Exod,21005,"&ldquo;But if the servant plainly says, &lsquo;I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,&rsquo;"
16770,2084,1,Exod,21006,"&ldquo;then his master shall bring him to the judges. He shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him forever."
16771,2085,1,Exod,21007,"&ldquo;And if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do."
16772,2086,1,Exod,21008,"&ldquo;If she does not please her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her."
16773,2087,1,Exod,21009,"&ldquo;And if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters."
16774,2088,1,Exod,21010,"&ldquo;If he takes another wife, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marriage rights."
16775,2089,1,Exod,21011,"&ldquo;And if he does not do these three for her, then she shall go out free, without paying money."
16776,2090,1,Exod,21012,"&ldquo;He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death."
16777,2091,1,Exod,21013,"&ldquo;However, if he did not lie in wait, but God delivered him into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee."
16778,2092,1,Exod,21014,"&ldquo;But if a man acts with premeditation against his neighbor, to kill him by treachery, you shall take him from My altar, that he may die."
16779,2093,1,Exod,21015,"&ldquo;And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death."
16780,2094,1,Exod,21016,"&ldquo;He who kidnaps a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall surely be put to death."
16781,2095,1,Exod,21017,"&ldquo;And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death."
16782,2096,1,Exod,21018,"&ldquo;If men contend with each other, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to his bed,"
16783,2097,1,Exod,21019,"&ldquo;if he rises again and walks about outside with his staff, then he who struck him shall be acquitted. He shall only pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for him to be thoroughly healed."
16784,2098,1,Exod,21020,"&ldquo;And if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished."

16850,2164,1,Exod,23019,"&ldquo;The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the Lord your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother&rsquo;s milk."

16853,2167,1,Exod,23022,"&ldquo;But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries."
16854,2168,1,Exod,23023,"&ldquo;For My Angel will go before you and bring you in to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off."
16855,2257,1,Exod,26021,"&ldquo;and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each of the boards."
16856,2258,1,Exod,26022,"&ldquo;For the far side of the tabernacle, westward, you shall make six boards."
16857,2259,1,Exod,26023,"&ldquo;And you shall also make two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle."
16858,2260,1,Exod,26024,"&ldquo;They shall be coupled together at the bottom and they shall be coupled together at the top by one ring. Thus it shall be for both of them. They shall be for the two corners."
16859,2261,1,Exod,26025,"&ldquo;So there shall be eight boards with their sockets of silver &ndash; sixteen sockets &ndash; two sockets under each of the boards."
16860,2262,1,Exod,26026,"&ldquo;And you shall make bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,"

16862,2264,1,Exod,26028,"&ldquo;The middle bar shall pass through the midst of the boards from end to end."
16863,2265,1,Exod,26029,"&ldquo;You shall overlay the boards with gold, make their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlay the bars with gold."
16864,2266,1,Exod,26030,"&ldquo;And you shall raise up the tabernacle according to its pattern which you were shown on the mountain."
16865,2267,1,Exod,26031,"&ldquo;You shall make a veil woven of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen. It shall be woven with an artistic design of cherubim."
16866,2268,1,Exod,26032,"&ldquo;You shall hang it upon the four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Their hooks shall be gold, upon four sockets of silver."
16867,2269,1,Exod,26033,"&ldquo;And you shall hang the veil from the clasps. Then you shall bring the ark of the Testimony in there, behind the veil. The veil shall be a divider for you between the holy place and the Most Holy."
16868,2270,1,Exod,26034,"&ldquo;You shall put the mercy seat upon the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy."
16869,2271,1,Exod,26035,"&ldquo;You shall set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand across from the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south; and you shall put the table on the north side."
16870,2272,1,Exod,26036,"&ldquo;You shall make a screen for the door of the tabernacle, woven of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen, made by a weaver."
16871,2273,1,Exod,26037,"&ldquo;And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be gold, and you shall cast five sockets of bronze for them."
16872,2274,1,Exod,27001,"&ldquo;You shall make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide &ndash; the altar shall be square &ndash; and its height shall be three cubits."
16873,2275,1,Exod,27002,"&ldquo;You shall make its horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it. And you shall overlay it with bronze."
16874,2276,1,Exod,27003,"&ldquo;Also you shall make its pans to receive its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze."
16875,2277,1,Exod,27004,"&ldquo;You shall make a grate for it, a network of bronze; and on the network you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners."
16876,2278,1,Exod,27005,"&ldquo;You shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, that the network may be midway up the altar."
16877,2279,1,Exod,27006,"&ldquo;And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze."
16878,2280,1,Exod,27007,"&ldquo;The poles shall be put in the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar to bear it."
16879,2281,1,Exod,27008,"&ldquo;You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown you on the mountain, so shall they make it."
16880,2282,1,Exod,27009,"&ldquo;You shall also make the court of the tabernacle. For the south side there shall be hangings for the court made of fine woven linen, one hundred cubits long for one side."
16881,2283,1,Exod,27010,"&ldquo;And its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be bronze. The hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be silver."
16882,2284,1,Exod,27011,"&ldquo;Likewise along the length of the north side there shall be hangings one hundred cubits long, with its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze, and the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver."
16883,2285,1,Exod,27012,"&ldquo;And along the width of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits, with their ten pillars and their ten sockets."
16884,2286,1,Exod,27013,"&ldquo;The width of the court on the east side shall be fifty cubits."
16885,2287,1,Exod,27014,"&ldquo;The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets."

16890,2292,1,Exod,27019,"&ldquo;All the utensils of the tabernacle for all its service, all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court, shall be of bronze."
16891,2293,1,Exod,27020,"&ldquo;And you shall command the children of Israel that they bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to cause the lamp to burn continually."
16892,2294,1,Exod,27021,"&ldquo;In the tabernacle of meeting, outside the veil which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening until morning before the Lord. It shall be a statute forever to their generations on behalf of the children of Israel."

16895,2297,1,Exod,28003,"&ldquo;So you shall speak to all who are gifted artisans, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron&rsquo;s garments, to consecrate him, that he may minister to Me as priest."
16896,2298,1,Exod,28004,"&ldquo;And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, an ephod,a a robe, a skillfully woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. So they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons, that he may minister to Me as priest."
16897,2299,1,Exod,28005,"&ldquo;They shall take the gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and the fine linen,"
16898,2300,1,Exod,28006,"&ldquo;and they shall make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen, artistically worked."
16899,2301,1,Exod,28007,"&ldquo;It shall have two shoulder straps joined at its two edges, and so it shall be joined together."
16900,2302,1,Exod,28008,"&ldquo;And the intricately woven band of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same workmanship, made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen."
16901,2303,1,Exod,28009,"&ldquo;Then you shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel:"
16902,2304,1,Exod,28010,"&ldquo;six of their names on one stone and six names on the other stone, in order of their birth."
16903,2305,1,Exod,28011,"&ldquo;With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel. You shall set them in settings of gold."
16904,2306,1,Exod,28012,"&ldquo;And you shall put the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. So Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord on his two shoulders as a memorial."
16905,2307,1,Exod,28013,"&ldquo;You shall also make settings of gold,"
16906,2308,1,Exod,28014,"&ldquo;and you shall make two chains of pure gold like braided cords, and fasten the braided chains to the settings."
16907,2309,1,Exod,28015,"&ldquo;You shall make the breastplate of judgment. Artistically woven according to the workmanship of the ephod you shall make it: of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen, you shall make it."
16908,2310,1,Exod,28016,"&ldquo;It shall be doubled into a square: a span shall be its length, and a span shall be its width."
16909,2311,1,Exod,28017,"&ldquo;And you shall put settings of stones in it, four rows of stones: The first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald; this shall be the first row;"
16910,2312,1,Exod,28018,"&ldquo;the second row shall be a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;"
16911,2313,1,Exod,28019,"&ldquo;the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;"
16912,2314,1,Exod,28020,"&ldquo;and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They shall be set in gold settings."
16913,2315,1,Exod,28021,"&ldquo;And the stones shall have the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, each one with its own name; they shall be according to the twelve tribes."
16914,2316,1,Exod,28022,"&ldquo;You shall make chains for the breastplate at the end, like braided cords of pure gold."
16915,2317,1,Exod,28023,"&ldquo;And you shall make two rings of gold for the breastplate, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate."
16916,2318,1,Exod,28024,"&ldquo;Then you shall put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate;"
16917,2319,1,Exod,28025,"&ldquo;and the other two ends of the two braided chains you shall fasten to the two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod in the front."
16918,2320,1,Exod,28026,"&ldquo;You shall make two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which is on the inner side of the ephod."
16919,2321,1,Exod,28027,"&ldquo;And two other rings of gold you shall make, and put them on the two shoulder straps, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod."
16920,2322,1,Exod,28028,"&ldquo;They shall bind the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod, using a blue cord, so that it is above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and so that the breastplate does not come loose from the ephod."
16921,2323,1,Exod,28029,"&ldquo;So Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel on the breastplate of judgment over his heart, when he goes into the holy place, as a memorial before the Lord continually."
16922,2324,1,Exod,28030,"&ldquo;And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim,a and they shall be over Aaron&rsquo;s heart when he goes in before the Lord. So Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel over his heart before the Lord continually."
16923,2325,1,Exod,28031,"&ldquo;You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue."
16924,2326,1,Exod,28032,"&ldquo;There shall be an opening for his head in the middle of it; it shall have a woven binding all around its opening, like the opening in a coat of mail, so that it does not tear."
16925,2327,1,Exod,28033,"&ldquo;And upon its hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet, all around its hem, and bells of gold between them all around:"
16926,2328,1,Exod,28034,"&ldquo;a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe all around."
16927,2329,1,Exod,28035,"&ldquo;And it shall be upon Aaron when he ministers, and its sound will be heard when he goes into the holy place before the Lord and when he comes out, that he may not die."
16928,2330,1,Exod,28036,"&ldquo;You shall also make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet:"
16929,2331,1,Exod,28037,"&ldquo;And you shall put it on a blue cord, that it may be on the turban; it shall be on the front of the turban."
16930,2332,1,Exod,28038,"&ldquo;So it shall be on Aaron&rsquo;s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of Israel hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall always be on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord."
16931,2333,1,Exod,28039,"&ldquo;You shall skillfully weave the tunic of fine linen thread, you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the sash of woven work."
16932,2334,1,Exod,28040,"&ldquo;For Aaron&rsquo;s sons you shall make tunics, and you shall make sashes for them. And you shall make hats for them, for glory and beauty."
16933,2335,1,Exod,28041,"&ldquo;So you shall put them on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him. You shall anoint them, consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to Me as priests."
16934,2336,1,Exod,28042,"&ldquo;And you shall make for them linen trousers to cover their nakedness; they shall reach from the waist to the thighs."
16935,2337,1,Exod,28043,"&ldquo;They shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they come into the tabernacle of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place, that they do not incur iniquity and die. It shall be a statute forever to him and his descendants after "
16936,2338,1,Exod,29001,"&ldquo;And this is what you shall do to them to hallow them for ministering to Me as priests: Take one young bull and two rams without blemish,"
16937,2339,1,Exod,29002,"&ldquo;and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil (you shall make them of wheat flour)."
16938,2340,1,Exod,29003,"&ldquo;You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, with the bull and the two rams."
16939,2341,1,Exod,29004,"&ldquo;And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and you shall wash them with water."
16940,2342,1,Exod,29005,"&ldquo;Then you shall take the garments, put the tunic on Aaron, and the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the intricately woven band of the ephod."
16941,2343,1,Exod,29006,"&ldquo;You shall put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban."
16942,2431,1,Exod,31010,"&ldquo;the garments of ministry,a the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests,"
16943,2432,1,Exod,31011,"&ldquo;and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded you they shall do.&rdquo;"
16944,2433,1,Exod,31012,"And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,"
16945,2434,1,Exod,31013,"&ldquo;Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: &lsquo;Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you."
16946,2435,1,Exod,31014,"&lsquo;You shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people."
16947,2436,1,Exod,31015,"&lsquo;Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death."
16948,2437,1,Exod,31016,"&lsquo;Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant."
16949,2438,1,Exod,31017,"&lsquo;It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16950,2439,1,Exod,31018,"And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God."
16951,2440,1,Exod,32001,"Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to Aaron, and said to him, &ldquo;Come, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do"
16952,2441,1,Exod,32002,"And Aaron said to them, &ldquo;Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.&rdquo;"
16953,2442,1,Exod,32003,"So all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron."
16954,2443,1,Exod,32004,"And he received the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molded calf. Then they said, &ldquo;This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!&rdquo;"
16955,2444,1,Exod,32005,"So when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, &ldquo;Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord.&rdquo;"
16956,2445,1,Exod,32006,"Then they rose early on the next day, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
16957,2446,1,Exod,32007,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go, get down! For your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves."
16958,2447,1,Exod,32008,"&ldquo;They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, &lsquo;This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16959,2448,1,Exod,32009,"And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;I have seen this people, and indeed it is a stiff-necked people!"
16960,2449,1,Exod,32010,"&ldquo;Now therefore, let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.&rdquo;"
16961,2450,1,Exod,32011,"Then Moses pleaded with the Lord his God, and said: &ldquo;Lord, why does Your wrath burn hot against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
16962,2451,1,Exod,32012,"&ldquo;Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, &lsquo;He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth&rsquo;? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this harm to Your people."
16963,2452,1,Exod,32013,"&ldquo;Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, &lsquo;I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven; and all this land that I have spoken of I give to your descendants, and they shall inherit"
16964,2453,1,Exod,32014,So the Lord relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people.
16965,2454,1,Exod,32015,"And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand. The tablets were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other they were written."
16966,2455,1,Exod,32016,"Now the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets."
16967,2456,1,Exod,32017,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, &ldquo;There is a noise of war in the camp.&rdquo;"
16968,2457,1,Exod,32018,"But he said: &ldquo;It is not the noise of the shout of victory, Nor the noise of the cry of defeat, But the sound of singing I hear.&rdquo;"
16969,2458,1,Exod,32019,"So it was, as soon as he came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. So Moses&rsquo; anger became hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain."
16970,2547,1,Exod,35015,"&lsquo;the incense altar, its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the screen for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle;"
16971,2548,1,Exod,35016,"&lsquo;the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, all its utensils, and the laver and its base;"
16972,2549,1,Exod,35017,"&lsquo;the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;"
16973,2550,1,Exod,35018,"&lsquo;the pegs of the tabernacle, the pegs of the court, and their cords;"
16974,2551,1,Exod,35019,"&lsquo;the garments of ministry, for ministering in the holy place &ndash; the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
16975,2552,1,Exod,35020,And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
16976,2553,1,Exod,35021,"Then everyone came whose heart was stirred, and everyone whose spirit was willing, and they brought the Lord&rsquo;s offering for the work of the tabernacle of meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments."
16977,2554,1,Exod,35022,"They came, both men and women, as many as had a willing heart, and brought earrings and nose rings, rings and necklaces, all jewelry of gold, that is, every man who made an offering of gold to the Lord."
16978,2555,1,Exod,35023,"And every man, with whom was found blue, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats&rsquo; hair, red skins of rams, and badger skins, brought them."
16979,2556,1,Exod,35024,"Everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the Lord&rsquo;s offering. And everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it."
16980,2557,1,Exod,35025,"All the women who were gifted artisans spun yarn with their hands, and brought what they had spun, of blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine linen."
16981,2558,1,Exod,35026,"And all the women whose hearts stirred with wisdom spun yarn of goats&rsquo; hair."
16982,2559,1,Exod,35027,"The rulers brought onyx stones, and the stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate,"
16983,2560,1,Exod,35028,"and spices and oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense."
16984,2561,1,Exod,35029,"The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to the Lord, all the men and women whose hearts were willing to bring material for all kinds of work which the Lord, by the hand of Moses, had commanded to be done."
16985,2562,1,Exod,35030,"And Moses said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;"
16986,2563,1,Exod,35031,"&ldquo;and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, in knowledge and all manner of workmanship,"
16987,2564,1,Exod,35032,"&ldquo;to design artistic works, to work in gold and silver and bronze,"
16988,2565,1,Exod,35033,"&ldquo;in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of artistic workmanship."
16989,2566,1,Exod,35034,"&ldquo;And He has put in his heart the ability to teach, in him and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan."
16990,2567,1,Exod,35035,"&ldquo;He has filled them with skill to do all manner of work of the engraver and the designer and the tapestry maker, in blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen, and of the weaver &ndash; those who do every work and those who design artistic works."
16991,2568,1,Exod,36001,"&ldquo;And Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in whom the Lord has put wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, shall do according to all that the Lord has commanded.&rdquo;"
16992,2569,1,Exod,36002,"Then Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, everyone whose heart was stirred, to come and do the work."
16993,2570,1,Exod,36003,And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of making the sanctuary. So they continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
16994,2571,1,Exod,36004,"Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing,"
16995,2572,1,Exod,36005,"and they spoke to Moses, saying, &ldquo;The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded us to do.&rdquo;"
16996,2573,1,Exod,36006,"So Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, &ldquo;Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.&rdquo; And the people were restrained from bringing,"
16997,2574,1,Exod,36007,"for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done &ndash; indeed too much."
16998,2575,1,Exod,36008,"Then all the gifted artisans among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains woven of fine linen, and of blue, purple, and scarlet thread; with artistic designs of cherubim they made them."
16999,2576,1,Exod,36009,"The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the curtains were all the same size."
17000,2577,1,Exod,36010,"And he coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another."
17001,2578,1,Exod,36011,"He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the curtain on the selvedge of one set; likewise he did on the outer edge of the other curtain of the second set."
17002,2579,1,Exod,36012,"Fifty loops he made on one curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain on the end of the second set; the loops held one curtain to another."
17003,2580,1,Exod,36013,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps, that it might be one tabernacle."
17004,2581,1,Exod,36014,"He made curtains of goats&rsquo; hair for the tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains."
17005,2582,1,Exod,36015,"The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains were the same size."
17006,2583,1,Exod,36016,He coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
17007,2584,1,Exod,36017,"And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in one set, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain of the second set."
17008,2585,1,Exod,36018,"He also made fifty bronze clasps to couple the tent together, that it might be one."
17009,2586,1,Exod,36019,"Then he made a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red, and a covering of badger skins above that."
17010,2587,1,Exod,36020,"For the tabernacle he made boards of acacia wood, standing upright."
17011,2588,1,Exod,36021,"The length of each board was ten cubits, and the width of each board a cubit and a half."
17012,2589,1,Exod,36022,Each board had two tenons for binding one to another. Thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.
17013,2590,1,Exod,36023,"And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side."
17014,2591,1,Exod,36024,Forty sockets of silver he made to go under the twenty boards: two sockets under each of the boards for its two tenons.
17015,2592,1,Exod,36025,"And for the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards"
17016,2593,1,Exod,36026,and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each of the boards.
17017,2594,1,Exod,36027,For the west side of the tabernacle he made six boards.
17018,2595,1,Exod,36028,He also made two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
17019,2596,1,Exod,36029,And they were coupled at the bottom and coupled together at the top by one ring. Thus he made both of them for the two corners.
17020,2597,1,Exod,36030,"So there were eight boards and their sockets &ndash; sixteen sockets of silver &ndash; two sockets under each of the boards."
17021,2598,1,Exod,36031,"And he made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,"
17022,2599,1,Exod,36032,"five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle on the far side westward."
17023,2600,1,Exod,36033,And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from one end to the other.
17024,2601,1,Exod,36034,"He overlaid the boards with gold, made their rings of gold to be holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold."
17025,2602,1,Exod,36035,"And he made a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen; it was worked with an artistic design of cherubim."
17026,2603,1,Exod,36036,"He made for it four pillars of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them."
17027,2604,1,Exod,36037,"He also made a screen for the tabernacle door, of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen, made by a weaver,"
17028,2605,1,Exod,36038,"and its five pillars with their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their rings with gold, but their five sockets were bronze."
17029,2606,1,Exod,37001,"Then Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits was its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height."
17030,2607,1,Exod,37002,"He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold all around it."
17031,2608,1,Exod,37003,"And he cast for it four rings of gold to be set in its four corners: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side of it."
17032,2609,1,Exod,37004,"He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold."
17033,2610,1,Exod,37005,"And he put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
17034,2611,1,Exod,37006,"He also made the mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits was its length and a cubit and a half its width."
17035,2612,1,Exod,37007,"He made two cherubim of beaten gold; he made them of one piece at the two ends of the mercy seat:"
17036,2613,1,Exod,37008,"one cherub at one end on this side, and the other cherub at the other end on that side. He made the cherubim at the two ends of one piece with the mercy seat."
17037,2614,1,Exod,37009,"The cherubim spread out their wings above, and covered the mercy seat with their wings. They faced one another; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat."
17038,2615,1,Exod,37010,"He made the table of acacia wood; two cubits was its length, a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height."
17039,2616,1,Exod,37011,"And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold all around it."
17040,2617,1,Exod,37012,"Also he made a frame of a handbreadth all around it, and made a molding of gold for the frame all around it."
17041,2618,1,Exod,37013,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that were at its four legs."
17042,2619,1,Exod,37014,"The rings were close to the frame, as holders for the poles to bear the table."
17043,2620,1,Exod,37015,"And he made the poles of acacia wood to bear the table, and overlaid them with gold."
17044,2621,1,Exod,37016,"He made of pure gold the utensils which were on the table: its dishes, its cups, its bowls, and its pitchers for pouring."
17045,2622,1,Exod,37017,"He also made the lampstand of pure gold; of hammered work he made the lampstand. Its shaft, its branches, its bowls, its ornamental knobs, and its flowers were of the same piece."
17046,2623,1,Exod,37018,"And six branches came out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side."
17047,2624,1,Exod,37019,"There were three bowls made like almond blossoms on one branch, with an ornamental knob and a flower, and three bowls made like almond blossoms on the other branch, with an ornamental knob and a flower &ndash; and so for the six branches coming out of the lampsta"
17048,2625,1,Exod,37020,"And on the lampstand itself were four bowls made like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and flower."
17049,2626,1,Exod,37021,"There was a knob under the first two branches of the same, a knob under the second two branches of the same, and a knob under the third two branches of the same, according to the six branches extending from it."
17050,2627,1,Exod,37022,"Their knobs and their branches were of one piece; all of it was one hammered piece of pure gold."
17051,2628,1,Exod,37023,"And he made its seven lamps, its wick-trimmers, and its trays of pure gold."
17052,2629,1,Exod,37024,"Of a talent of pure gold he made it, with all its utensils."
17053,2630,1,Exod,37025,"He made the incense altar of acacia wood. Its length was a cubit and its width a cubit &ndash; it was square &ndash; and two cubits was its height. Its horns were of one piece with it."
17054,2631,1,Exod,37026,"And he overlaid it with pure gold: its top, its sides all around, and its horns. He also made for it a molding of gold all around it."
17055,2632,1,Exod,37027,"He made two rings of gold for it under its molding, by its two corners on both sides, as holders for the poles with which to bear it."
17056,2633,1,Exod,37028,"And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold."
17057,2634,1,Exod,37029,"He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the perfumer."

17061,2638,1,Exod,38004,"And he made a grate of bronze network for the altar, under its rim, midway from the bottom."

17625,4110,1,Num,14007,"and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: &ldquo;The land we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land."
17626,4111,1,Num,14008,"If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, &lsquo;a land which flows with milk and honey.&rsquo;"
17627,4112,1,Num,14009,"Only do not rebel against the LORD, nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their protection has departed from them, and the LORD is with us. Do not fear them.&rdquo;"
17628,4113,1,Num,14010,And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Now the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of meeting before all the children of Israel.
17629,4114,1,Num,14011,"Then the LORD said to Moses: &ldquo;How long will these people reject Me? And how long will they not believe Me, with all the signs which I have performed among them?"
17630,4115,1,Num,14012,"I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.&rdquo;"
17631,4116,1,Num,14013,"And Moses said to the LORD: &ldquo;Then the Egyptians will hear it, for by Your might You brought these people up from among them,"
17632,4117,1,Num,14014,"and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, are among these people; that You, LORD, are seen face to face and Your cloud stands above them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
17633,4118,1,Num,14015,"Now if You kill these people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying,"
17634,4119,1,Num,14016,"&lsquo;Because the LORD was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them, therefore He killed them in the wilderness.&rsquo;"
17635,4120,1,Num,14017,"And now, I pray, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,"
17636,4121,1,Num,14018,"&lsquo;The LORD is longsuffering and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He by no means clears the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation.&rsquo;"
17637,4122,1,Num,14019,"Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.&rdquo;"
17638,4123,1,Num,14020,"Then the LORD said: &ldquo;I have pardoned, according to your word;"
17639,4124,1,Num,14021,"but truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD &ndash; "
17640,4125,1,Num,14022,"because all these men who have seen My glory and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have put Me to the test now these ten times, and have not heeded My voice,"
17641,4126,1,Num,14023,"they certainly shall not see the land of which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it."
17642,4127,1,Num,14024,"But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land where he went, and his descendants shall inherit it."
17643,4128,1,Num,14025,"Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley; tomorrow turn and move out into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.&rdquo;"
17644,4129,1,Num,14026,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
17645,4215,1,Num,16026,"And he spoke to the congregation, saying, &ldquo;Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.&rdquo;"
17646,4216,1,Num,16027,"So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children."
17647,4217,1,Num,16028,"And Moses said: &ldquo;By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own will."
17648,4218,1,Num,16029,"If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are visited by the common fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me."
17649,4219,1,Num,16030,"But if the LORD creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the LORD.&rdquo;"
17650,4220,1,Num,16031,"Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them,"
17651,4221,1,Num,16032,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all their goods."
17652,4222,1,Num,16033,"So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly."
17653,4223,1,Num,16034,"Then all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, &ldquo;Lest the earth swallow us up also!&rdquo;"
17654,4224,1,Num,16035,And a fire came out from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.
17655,4225,1,Num,16036,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
17656,4226,1,Num,16037,"&ldquo;Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for they are holy, and scatter the fire some distance away."
17657,4227,1,Num,16038,"The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar. Because they presented them before the LORD, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.&rdquo;"
17658,4228,1,Num,16039,"So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar,"
17659,4229,1,Num,16040,"to be a memorial to the children of Israel that no outsider, who is not a descendant of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD, that he might not become like Korah and his companions, just as the LORD had said to him through Moses."
17660,4230,1,Num,16041,"On the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying, &ldquo;You have killed the people of the LORD.&rdquo;"
17661,4231,1,Num,16042,"Now it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting; and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared."
17662,4232,1,Num,16043,Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.
17663,4233,1,Num,16044,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
17664,4234,1,Num,16045,"&ldquo;Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&rdquo;"
17665,4235,1,Num,16046,And they fell on their faces.
17666,4236,1,Num,16047,"So Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense on it, and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from the LORD. The plague has begun.&rdquo;"
17667,4237,1,Num,16048,"Then Aaron took it as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and already the plague had begun among the people. So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people."
17668,4238,1,Num,16049,"And he stood between the dead and the living; so the plague was stopped."
17669,4239,1,Num,16050,"Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the Korah incident."
17670,4240,1,Num,17001,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:"
17671,4241,1,Num,17002,"&ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, and get from them a rod from each father&rsquo;s house, all their leaders according to their fathers&rsquo; houses &ndash; twelve rods. Write each man&rsquo;s name on his rod."
17672,4242,1,Num,17003,"And you shall write Aaron&rsquo;s name on the rod of Levi. For there shall be one rod for the head of each father&rsquo;s house."
17673,4243,1,Num,17004,"Then you shall place them in the tabernacle of meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you."
17674,4244,1,Num,17005,"And it shall be that the rod of the man whom I choose will blossom; thus I will rid Myself of the complaints of the children of Israel, which they make against you.&rdquo;"
17675,4245,1,Num,17006,"So Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods."
17676,4246,1,Num,17007,And Moses placed the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
17677,4247,1,Num,17008,"Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and behold, the rod of Aaron, of the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth buds, had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds."
17678,4248,1,Num,17009,"Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod."
17679,4249,1,Num,17010,"And the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Bring Aaron&rsquo;s rod back before the Testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put their complaints away from Me, lest they die.&rdquo;"
17680,4250,1,Num,17011,"Thus did Moses; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did."
17681,4251,1,Num,17012,"So the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, &ldquo;Surely we die, we perish, we all perish!"
17682,4252,1,Num,18001,"Then the LORD said to Aaron: &ldquo;You and your sons and your father&rsquo;s house with you shall bear the iniquity related to the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity associated with your priesthood."
17683,4253,1,Num,18002,"Also bring with you your brethren of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you while you and your sons are with you before the tabernacle of witness."
17684,4254,1,Num,18003,"They shall attend to your needs and all the needs of the tabernacle; but they shall not come near the articles of the sanctuary and the altar, lest they die &ndash; they and you also."
17685,4255,1,Num,18004,"They shall be joined with you and attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting, for all the work of the tabernacle; but an outsider shall not come near you."
17686,4256,1,Num,18005,"And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar, that there may be no more wrath on the children of Israel."
17687,4257,1,Num,18006,"Behold, I Myself have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; they are a gift to you, given by the LORD, to do the work of the tabernacle of meeting."
17688,4258,1,Num,18007,"Therefore you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything at the altar and behind the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood to you as a gift for service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.&rdquo;"
17689,4259,1,Num,18008,"And the LORD spoke to Aaron: &ldquo;Here, I Myself have also given you charge of My heave offerings, all the holy gifts of the children of Israel; I have given them as a portion to you and your sons, as an ordinance forever."
17690,4260,1,Num,18009,"This shall be yours of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering and every sin offering and every trespass offering which they render to Me, shall be most holy for you and your sons."
17691,4261,1,Num,18010,"In a most holy place you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you."
17692,4262,1,Num,18011,"&ldquo;This also is yours: the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them to you, and your sons and daughters with you, as an ordinance forever. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it."
17693,4263,1,Num,18012,"&ldquo;All the best of the oil, all the best of the new wine and the grain, their firstfruits which they offer to the LORD, I have given them to you."
17694,4264,1,Num,18013,"Whatever first ripe fruit is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it."
17695,4265,1,Num,18014,"&ldquo;Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours."
17696,4266,1,Num,18015,"&ldquo;Everything that first opens the womb of all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether man or beast, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem."
17697,4267,1,Num,18016,"And those redeemed of the devoted things you shall redeem when one month old, according to your valuation, for five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."
17698,4268,1,Num,18017,"But the firstborn of a cow, the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn their fat as an offering made by fire for a sweet aroma to the LORD."
17699,4269,1,Num,18018,"And their flesh shall be yours, just as the wave breast and the right thigh are yours."
17700,4270,1,Num,18019,"&ldquo;All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and your sons and daughters with you as an ordinance forever; it is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD with you and your descendants with you.&rdquo;"
17701,4271,1,Num,18020,"Then the LORD said to Aaron: &ldquo;You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel."
17702,4272,1,Num,18021,"&ldquo;Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work which they perform, the work of the tabernacle of meeting."
17703,4273,1,Num,18022,"Hereafter the children of Israel shall not come near the tabernacle of meeting, lest they bear sin and die."
17704,4274,1,Num,18023,"But the Levites shall perform the work of the tabernacle of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a statute forever, throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
17705,4275,1,Num,18024,"For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer up as a heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, &lsquo;Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
17706,4276,1,Num,18025,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
17707,4277,1,Num,18026,"&ldquo;Speak thus to the Levites, and say to them: &lsquo;When you take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering of it to the LORD, a tenth of the tithe."
17708,4278,1,Num,18027,And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the winepress.
17709,4279,1,Num,18028,"Thus you shall also offer a heave offering to the LORD from all your tithes which you receive from the children of Israel, and you shall give the LORD&rsquo;s heave offering from it to Aaron the priest."
17710,4280,1,Num,18029,"Of all your gifts you shall offer up every heave offering due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the consecrated part of them.&rsquo;"
17711,4281,1,Num,18030,"Therefore you shall say to them: &lsquo;When you have lifted up the best of it, then the rest shall be accounted to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress."
17712,4282,1,Num,18031,"You may eat it in any place, you and your households, for it is your reward for your work in the tabernacle of meeting."
17713,4283,1,Num,18032,"And you shall bear no sin because of it, when you have lifted up the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy gifts of the children of Israel, lest you die.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
17714,4284,1,Num,19001,"Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,"
17715,4285,1,Num,19002,"&ldquo;This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying: &lsquo;Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect and on which a yoke has never come."
17716,4286,1,Num,19003,"You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, that he may take it outside the camp, and it shall be slaughtered before him;"
17717,4287,1,Num,19004,"and Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven times directly in front of the tabernacle of meeting."
17718,4288,1,Num,19005,"Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its offal shall be burned."
17719,4289,1,Num,19006,"And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the fire burning the heifer."
17720,4290,1,Num,19007,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, he shall bathe in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; the priest shall be unclean until evening."
17721,4291,1,Num,19008,"And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water, bathe in water, and shall be unclean until evening."
17722,4292,1,Num,19009,"Then a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and store them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for the water of purification; it is for purifying from sin."
17723,4293,1,Num,19010,"And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. It shall be a statute forever to the children of Israel and to the stranger who dwells among them."
17724,4294,1,Num,19011,"&lsquo;He who touches the dead body of anyone shall be unclean seven days."
17725,4295,1,Num,19012,"He shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean."
17726,4296,1,Num,19013,"Whoever touches the body of anyone who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person shall be cut off from Israel. He shall be unclean, because the water of purification was not sprinkled on him; his uncleanness is still on him."
17727,4297,1,Num,19014,"&lsquo;This is the law when a man dies in a tent: All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent shall be unclean seven days;"
17728,4298,1,Num,19015,"and every open vessel, which has no cover fastened on it, is unclean."
17729,4299,1,Num,19016,"Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain by a sword or who has died, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
17730,4300,1,Num,19017,"&lsquo;And for an unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the heifer burnt for purification from sin, and running water shall be put on them in a vessel."
17731,4301,1,Num,19018,"A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or a grave."
17732,4302,1,Num,19019,"The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, wash his clothes, and bathe in water; and at evening he shall be clean."
17733,4303,1,Num,19020,"&lsquo;But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from among the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of purification has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean."
17734,4304,1,Num,19021,"It shall be a perpetual statute for them. He who sprinkles the water of purification shall wash his clothes; and he who touches the water of purification shall be unclean until evening. 22 Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
17735,4305,1,Num,20001,"Then the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the Wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there and was buried there."
17736,4306,1,Num,20002,"Now there was no water for the congregation; so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron."
17737,4307,1,Num,20003,"And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying: &ldquo;If only we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!"
17738,4308,1,Num,20004,"Why have you brought up the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our animals should die here?"
17739,4309,1,Num,20005,"And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor is there any water to drink.&rdquo;"
17740,4310,1,Num,20006,"So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and they fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them."
17741,4311,1,Num,20007,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
17742,4312,1,Num,20008,"&ldquo;Take the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their animals.&rdquo;"
17743,4313,1,Num,20009,So Moses took the rod from before the LORD as He commanded him.
17744,4314,1,Num,20010,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, &ldquo;Hear now, you rebels! Must we bring water for you out of this rock?&rdquo;"
17745,4315,1,Num,20011,"Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their animals drank."
17746,4316,1,Num,20012,"Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, &ldquo;Because you did not believe Me, to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.&rdquo;"
17747,4317,1,Num,20013,"This was the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel contended with the LORD, and He was hallowed among them."
17748,4318,1,Num,20014,"Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. &ldquo;Thus says your brother Israel: &lsquo;You know all the hardship that has befallen us,"
17749,4319,1,Num,20015,"how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers."
17750,4320,1,Num,20016,"When we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border."
17751,4321,1,Num,20017,"Please let us pass through your country. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the King&rsquo;s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
17752,4322,1,Num,20018,"Then Edom said to him, &ldquo;You shall not pass through my land, lest I come out against you with the sword.&rdquo;"
17753,4323,1,Num,20019,"So the children of Israel said to him, &ldquo;We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.&rdquo;"
17754,4324,1,Num,20020,"Then he said, &ldquo;You shall not pass through.&rdquo; So Edom came out against them with many men and with a strong hand."
17755,4325,1,Num,20021,"Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him."
17756,4326,1,Num,20022,"Now the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor."
17757,4327,1,Num,20023,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying:"
17758,4328,1,Num,20024,"&ldquo;Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah."
17759,4329,1,Num,20025,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;"
17760,4330,1,Num,20026,"and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there.&rdquo;"
17761,4331,1,Num,20027,"So Moses did just as the LORD commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation."
17762,4332,1,Num,20028,"Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain."
17763,4333,1,Num,20029,"Now when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days."
17764,4334,1,Num,21001,"The king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South, heard that Israel was coming on the road to Atharim. Then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners."
17765,4335,1,Num,21002,"So Israel made a vow to the LORD, and said, &ldquo;If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.&rdquo;"
17766,4336,1,Num,21003,"And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of that place was called Hormah."
17767,4337,1,Num,21004,"Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became very discouraged on the way."
17768,4338,1,Num,21005,"And the people spoke against God and against Moses: &ldquo;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.&rdquo;"
17769,4339,1,Num,21006,"So the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died."
17770,4340,1,Num,21007,"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, &ldquo;We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD that He take away the serpents from us.&rdquo; So Moses prayed for the people."
17771,4341,1,Num,21008,"Then the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.&rdquo;"
17772,4342,1,Num,21009,"So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived."
17773,4343,1,Num,21010,Now the children of Israel moved on and camped in Oboth.
17774,4344,1,Num,21011,"And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which is east of Moab, toward the sunrise."
17775,4345,1,Num,21012,From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered.
17776,4346,1,Num,21013,"From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
17777,4347,1,Num,21014,"Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD: &ldquo; Waheb in Suphah, The brooks of the Arnon,"
17778,4348,1,Num,21015,"And the slope of the brooks That reaches to the dwelling of Ar, And lies on the border of Moab.&rdquo;"
17779,4349,1,Num,21016,"From there they went to Beer, which is the well where the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Gather the people together, and I will give them water.&rdquo;"
17780,4350,1,Num,21017,"Then Israel sang this song: &ldquo; Spring up, O well! All of you sing to it &ndash; "
17781,4351,1,Num,21018,"The well the leaders sank, Dug by the nation&rsquo;s nobles, By the lawgiver, with their staves.&rdquo;"
17782,4352,1,Num,21019,"And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,"
17783,4353,1,Num,21020,"from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
17784,4354,1,Num,21021,"and from Bamoth, in the valley that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down on the wasteland."
17785,4355,1,Num,21022,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
17786,4356,1,Num,21023,"&ldquo;Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the King&rsquo;s Highway until we have passed through your territory.&rdquo;"
17787,4357,1,Num,21024,"But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel."
17788,4358,1,Num,21025,"Then Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the people of Ammon; for the border of the people of Ammon was fortified."
17789,4359,1,Num,21026,"So Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages."
17790,4360,1,Num,21027,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon."
17791,4361,1,Num,21028,"Therefore those who speak in proverbs say: &ldquo;Come to Heshbon, let it be built; Let the city of Sihon be repaired."
17792,4362,1,Num,21029,"&ldquo;For fire went out from Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon; It consumed Ar of Moab, The lords of the heights of the Arnon."
17793,4363,1,Num,21030,"Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To Sihon king of the Amorites."
17794,4364,1,Num,21031,"&ldquo;But we have shot at them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon. Then we laid waste as far as Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.&rdquo;"
17795,4365,1,Num,21032,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
17796,4366,1,Num,21033,"Then Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there."
17797,4367,1,Num,21034,"And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
17798,4368,1,Num,21035,"Then the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.&rdquo;"
17799,4369,1,Num,22001,"Then the children of Israel moved, and camped in the plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan across from Jericho."
17800,4370,1,Num,22002,Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
17801,4371,1,Num,22003,"And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the children of Israel."
17802,4372,1,Num,22004,"So Moab said to the elders of Midian, &ldquo;Now this company will lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.&rdquo; And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time."
17803,4373,1,Num,22005,"Then he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying: &ldquo;Look, a people has come from Egypt. See, they cover the face of the earth, and are settling next to me!"
17804,4374,1,Num,22006,"Therefore please come at once, curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.&rdquo;"
17805,4375,1,Num,22007,"So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviner&rsquo;s fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak."
17806,4376,1,Num,22008,"And he said to them, &ldquo;Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the LORD speaks to me.&rdquo; So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam."
17807,4377,1,Num,22009,"Then God came to Balaam and said, &ldquo;Who are these men with you?&rdquo;"
17808,4378,1,Num,22010,"So Balaam said to God, &ldquo;Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,"
17809,4379,1,Num,22011,"&lsquo;Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
17810,4380,1,Num,22012,"And God said to Balaam, &ldquo;You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.&rdquo;"
17811,4381,1,Num,22013,"So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, &ldquo;Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to give me permission to go with you.&rdquo;"
17812,4382,1,Num,22014,"And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, &ldquo;Balaam refuses to come with us.&rdquo;"
17813,4383,1,Num,22015,"Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more honorable than they."
17814,4384,1,Num,22016,"And they came to Balaam and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: &lsquo;Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me;"
17815,4385,1,Num,22017,"for I will certainly honor you greatly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
17816,4386,1,Num,22018,"Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, &ldquo;Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more."
17817,4387,1,Num,22019,"Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me.&rdquo;"
17818,4388,1,Num,22020,"And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, &ldquo;If the men come to call you, rise and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you &ndash; that you shall do.&rdquo;"
17819,4389,1,Num,22021,"So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab."
17820,4390,1,Num,22022,"Then God&rsquo;s anger was aroused because he went, and the Angel of the LORD took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him."
17821,4391,1,Num,22023,"Now the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road."
17822,4392,1,Num,22024,"Then the Angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side."
17823,4393,1,Num,22025,"And when the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam&rsquo;s foot against the wall; so he struck her again."
17824,4394,1,Num,22026,"Then the Angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left."
17825,4395,1,Num,22027,"And when the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam&rsquo;s anger was aroused, and he struck the donkey with his staff."
17826,4396,1,Num,22028,"Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &ldquo;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&rdquo;"
17827,4397,1,Num,22029,"And Balaam said to the donkey, &ldquo;Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!&rdquo;"
17828,4398,1,Num,22030,"So the donkey said to Balaam, &ldquo;Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to this day? Was I ever disposed to do this to you?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;"
17829,4399,1,Num,22031,"Then the LORD opened Balaam&rsquo;s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face."
17830,4400,1,Num,22032,"And the Angel of the LORD said to him, &ldquo;Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because your way is perverse before Me."
17831,4401,1,Num,22033,"The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&rdquo;"
17832,4402,1,Num,22034,"And Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD, &ldquo;I have sinned, for I did not know You stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases You, I will turn back.&rdquo;"
17833,4403,1,Num,22035,"Then the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam, &ldquo;Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak.&rdquo; So Balaam went with the princes of Balak."
17834,4404,1,Num,22036,"Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border at the Arnon, the boundary of the territory."
17835,4405,1,Num,22037,"Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?&rdquo;"
17836,4406,1,Num,22038,"And Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Look, I have come to you! Now, have I any power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I must speak.&rdquo;"
17837,4407,1,Num,22039,"So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth."
17838,4408,1,Num,22040,"Then Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent some to Balaam and to the princes who were with him."
17839,4409,1,Num,22041,"So it was, the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people."
17840,4410,1,Num,23001,"Then Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.&rdquo;"
17841,4411,1,Num,23002,"And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
17842,4412,1,Num,23003,"Then Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.&rdquo; So he went to a desolate height."
17843,4413,1,Num,23004,"And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, &ldquo;I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.&rdquo;"
17844,4414,1,Num,23005,"Then the LORD put a word in Balaam&rsquo;s mouth, and said, &ldquo;Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.&rdquo;"
17845,4415,1,Num,23006,"So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab."

17899,4726,1,Num,32016,"Then they came near to him and said: &ldquo;We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,"

17901,4728,1,Num,32018,We will not return to our homes until every one of the children of Israel has received his inheritance.
17902,4729,1,Num,32019,"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.&rdquo;"
17903,4730,1,Num,32020,"Then Moses said to them: &ldquo;If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before the LORD for the war,"

17905,4732,1,Num,32022,"and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you may return and be blameless before the LORD and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD."

17911,4738,1,Num,32028,"So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel."
17912,4739,1,Num,32029,"And Moses said to them: &ldquo;If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession."
17913,4740,1,Num,32030,"But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.&rdquo;"
17914,4741,1,Num,32031,"Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: &ldquo;As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do."

17916,4743,1,Num,32033,"So Moses gave to the children of Gad, to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities within the borders, the cities of the surrounding country."
17917,4744,1,Num,32034,"And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,"

17927,4754,1,Num,33002,Now Moses wrote down the starting points of their journeys at the command of the LORD. And these are their journeys according to their starting points:

The city shall be in the middle. This shall belong to them as common-land for the cities."
18016,4843,1,Num,35006,"&ldquo;Now among the cities which you will give to the Levites you shall appoint six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities."

18034,4861,1,Num,35024,then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments.
18035,4862,1,Num,35025,"So the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil."

18042,4869,1,Num,35032,"And you shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest."
18043,4870,1,Num,35033,"So you shall not pollute the land where you are; for blood defiles the land, and no atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it."

18048,4875,1,Num,36004,"And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.&rdquo;"
18049,4876,1,Num,36005,"Then Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: &ldquo;What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right."
18050,4877,1,Num,36006,"This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, &lsquo;Let them marry whom they think best, but they may marry only within the family of their father&rsquo;s tribe.&rsquo;"

18224,5723,1,Deut,31009,"So Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. "
18225,5724,1,Deut,31010,"And Moses commanded them, saying: &ldquo;At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Tabernacles, "

18229,5728,1,Deut,31014,"Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, the days approach when you must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that I may inaugurate him.&rdquo; So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting. "
18230,5729,1,Deut,31015,"Now the Lord appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle. "
18231,5730,1,Deut,31016,"And the Lord said to Moses: &ldquo;Behold, you will rest with your fathers; and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they go to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.

18235,5734,1,Deut,31020,"When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant. "
18236,5735,1,Deut,31021,"Then it shall be, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants, for I know the inclination of their behavior today, even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore to give them.&rdquo; "
18237,5736,1,Deut,31022,"Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel. "
18238,5737,1,Deut,31023,"Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun, and said, &ldquo;Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them, and I will be with you.&rdquo; "
18239,5738,1,Deut,31024,"So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book, when they were finished, "
18240,5739,1,Deut,31025,"that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying: "

18242,5741,1,Deut,31027,"for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the Lord, then how much more after my death? "
18243,5742,1,Deut,31028,"Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them. "
18244,5743,1,Deut,31029,"For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands. "
18245,5744,1,Deut,31030,Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were ended: 
18246,5745,1,Deut,32001,"Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. "
18247,5746,1,Deut,32002,"Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As raindrops on the tender herb, And as showers on the grass. "
18248,5747,1,Deut,32003,For I proclaim the name of the Lord: Ascribe greatness to our God. 
18249,5748,1,Deut,32004,"He is the Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are justice, A God of truth and without injustice; Righteous and upright is He. "
18250,5749,1,Deut,32005,"They have corrupted themselves; They are not His children, Because of their blemish: A perverse and crooked generation. "
18251,5750,1,Deut,32006,"Do you thus deal with the Lord, O foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who bought you? Has He not made you and established you? "
18252,5751,1,Deut,32007,"Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; Your elders, and they will tell you: "
18253,5752,1,Deut,32008,"When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations, When He separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel. "
18254,5753,1,Deut,32009,"For the Lord&rsquo;s portion is His people; Jacob is the place of His inheritance. "
18255,5754,1,Deut,32010,"He found him in a desert land And in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye. "

18257,5756,1,Deut,32012,"So the Lord alone led him, And there was no foreign god with him. "
18258,5757,1,Deut,32013,"He made him ride in the heights of the earth, That he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him draw honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock; "

18260,5759,1,Deut,32015,"But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; You grew fat, you grew thick, You are obese! Then he forsook God who made him, And scornfully esteemed the Rock of his salvation. "
18261,5760,1,Deut,32016,"They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger. "
18262,5761,1,Deut,32017,"They sacrificed to demons, not to God, To gods they did not know, To new gods, new arrivals That your fathers did not fear. "
18263,5762,1,Deut,32018,"Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful, And have forgotten the God who fathered you. "
18264,5763,1,Deut,32019,"And when the Lord saw it, He spurned them, Because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters. "
18265,5764,1,Deut,32020,"And He said: &lsquo;I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end will be, For they are a perverse generation, Children in whom is no faith. "
18266,5765,1,Deut,32021,"They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not God; They have moved Me to anger by their foolish idols. But I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a nation; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation. "
18267,5766,1,Deut,32022,"For a fire is kindled by my anger, And shall burn to the lowest hell; It shall consume the earth with her increase, And set on fire the foundations of the mountains. "
18268,5767,1,Deut,32023,"&rsquo;I will heap disasters on them; I will spend My arrows on them. "
18269,5768,1,Deut,32024,"They shall be wasted with hunger, Devoured by pestilence and bitter destruction; I will also send against them the teeth of beasts, With the poison of serpents of the dust. "
18270,5769,1,Deut,32025,"The sword shall destroy outside; There shall be terror within For the young man and virgin, The nursing child with the man of gray hairs. "
18271,5770,1,Deut,32026,"I would have said, I will dash them in pieces, I will make the memory of them to cease from among men, "
18272,5771,1,Deut,32027,"Had I not feared the wrath of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misunderstand, Lest they should say, Our hand is high; And it is not the Lord who has done all this. &lsquo; "
18273,5772,1,Deut,32028,"For they are a nation void of counsel, Nor is there any understanding in them. "

18275,5774,1,Deut,32030,"How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the Lord had surrendered them? "
18276,5775,1,Deut,32031,"For their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges. "
18277,5776,1,Deut,32032,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter. "
18278,5777,1,Deut,32033,"Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of cobras. "
18279,5778,1,Deut,32034,"&rsquo;Is this not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up among My treasures? "

18281,5780,1,Deut,32036,"For the Lord will judge His people And have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their power is gone, And there is no one remaining, bond or free. "
18282,5781,1,Deut,32037,"He will say: &lsquo;Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge? "
18283,5782,1,Deut,32038,"Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise and help you, And be your refuge. "
18284,5783,1,Deut,32039,"&rsquo;Now see that I, even I, am He, And there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; Nor is there any who can deliver from My hand. "
18285,5784,1,Deut,32040,"For I raise My hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever, "

18289,5788,1,Deut,32044,So Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.

18327,5826,1,Deut,34001,"Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan, "
18328,5827,1,Deut,34002,"all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,"
18329,5828,1,Deut,34003,"the South, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. "
18330,5829,1,Deut,34004,"Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;This is the land of which I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, &lsquo;I will give it to your descendants.&rsquo; I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.&rdquo; "
18331,5830,1,Deut,34005,"So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. "
18332,5831,1,Deut,34006,"And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day. "
18333,5832,1,Deut,34007,Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished. 
18334,5833,1,Deut,34008,And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended. 
18335,5834,1,Deut,34009,"Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses. "
18336,5835,1,Deut,34010,"But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, "

18338,5837,1,Deut,34012,and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel. 
18339,5838,1,Josh,1001,"After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses&rsquo; assistant, saying: "
18340,5839,1,Josh,1002,"Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them &ndash; the children of Israel. "
18341,5840,1,Josh,1003,"Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses. "
18342,5841,1,Josh,1004,"From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory. "
18343,5842,1,Josh,1005,"No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you. "
18344,5843,1,Josh,1006,"Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. "
18345,5844,1,Josh,1007,"Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. "
18346,5845,1,Josh,1008,"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. "
18347,5846,1,Josh,1009,"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. "
18348,5847,1,Josh,1010,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, "
18349,5848,1,Josh,1011,"Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, &lsquo;Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you will cross over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess.&rsquo; "
18350,5849,1,Josh,1012,"And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying, "
18351,5850,1,Josh,1013,"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, &lsquo;The Lord your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.&rsquo; "
18352,5851,1,Josh,1014,"Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, "
18353,5852,1,Josh,1015,"until the Lord has given your brethren rest, as He gave you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord&rsquo;s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise. "
18354,5853,1,Josh,1016,"So they answered Joshua, saying, &ldquo;All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. "
18355,5854,1,Josh,1017,"Just as we heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only the Lord your God be with you, as He was with Moses. "
18356,5855,1,Josh,1018,"Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.&rdquo; "
18357,5856,1,Josh,2001,"Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Acacia Grove* to spy secretly, saying, &ldquo;Go, view the land, especially Jericho.&rdquo; So they went, and came to the house of a harlot named Rahab, and lodged there. "
18358,5857,1,Josh,2002,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, &ldquo;Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country.&rdquo; "
18359,5858,1,Josh,2003,"So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, &ldquo;Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.&rdquo; "
18360,5859,1,Josh,2004,"Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, &ldquo;Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. "
18361,5860,1,Josh,2005,"And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.&rdquo; "
18362,5861,1,Josh,2006,"(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.) "
18363,5862,1,Josh,2007,"Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate. "
18364,5863,1,Josh,2008,"Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, "
18365,5864,1,Josh,2009,"and said to the men: &ldquo;I know that the Lord has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you. "
18366,5865,1,Josh,2010,"For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. "
18367,5866,1,Josh,2011,"And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the Lord your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath. "
18368,5867,1,Josh,2012,"Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the Lord, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father&rsquo;s house, and give me a true token, "
18369,5868,1,Josh,2013,"and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.&rdquo; "
18370,5958,1,Josh,6023,"And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel. "
18371,5959,1,Josh,6024,"But they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord. "
18372,5960,1,Josh,6025,"And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot, her father&rsquo;s household, and all that she had. So she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. "
18373,5961,1,Josh,6026,"Then Joshua charged them at that time, saying, &ldquo;Cursed be the man before the Lord who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.&rdquo; "
18374,5962,1,Josh,6027,"So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the country. "
18375,5963,1,Josh,7001,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the accursed things, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,* the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed things; so the anger of the Lord burned against the children of Israel. "
18376,5964,1,Josh,7002,"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Go up and spy out the country.&rdquo; So the men went up and spied out Ai. "
18377,5965,1,Josh,7003,"And they returned to Joshua and said to him, &ldquo;Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for the people of Ai are few.&rdquo; "
18378,5966,1,Josh,7004,"So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai. "
18379,5967,1,Josh,7005,"And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the hearts of the people melted and became like water. "
18380,5968,1,Josh,7006,"Then Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. "
18381,5969,1,Josh,7007,"And Joshua said, &ldquo;Alas, Lord God, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all &ndash; to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan! "
18382,5970,1,Josh,7008,"O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies? "
18383,5971,1,Josh,7009,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?&rdquo; "
18384,5972,1,Josh,7010,"So the Lord said to Joshua: &ldquo;Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? "
18385,5973,1,Josh,7011,"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff. "
18386,5974,1,Josh,7012,"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they have become doomed to destruction. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you. "
18387,5975,1,Josh,7013,"Get up, sanctify the people, and say, &lsquo;Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says the Lord God of Israel: &ldquo;There is an accursed thing in your midst, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you.&rdquo; "
18388,5976,1,Josh,7014,"In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the Lord takes shall come according to families; and the family which the Lord takes shall come by households; and the household which the Lord takes shall come man by man. "
18389,5977,1,Josh,7015,"Then it shall be that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
18390,5978,1,Josh,7016,"So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. "
18391,5979,1,Josh,7017,"He brought the clan of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. "
18392,5980,1,Josh,7018,"Then he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. "
18393,5981,1,Josh,7019,"Now Joshua said to Achan, &ldquo;My son, I beg you, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.&rdquo; "
18394,5982,1,Josh,7020,"And Achan answered Joshua and said, &ldquo;Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I have done: "
18395,5983,1,Josh,7021,"When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it. "
18396,5984,1,Josh,7022,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it. "
18397,5985,1,Josh,7023,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord. "
18398,5986,1,Josh,7024,"Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Achor. "
18399,5987,1,Josh,7025,"And Joshua said, &ldquo;Why have you troubled us? The Lord will trouble you this day.&rdquo; So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones. "
18400,5988,1,Josh,7026,"Then they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. So the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day. "
18401,5989,1,Josh,8001,"Now the Lord said to Joshua: &ldquo;Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. "
18402,5990,1,Josh,8002,"And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.&rdquo; "
18403,5991,1,Josh,8003,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night. "
18404,5992,1,Josh,8004,"And he commanded them, saying: &ldquo;Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready. "
18405,5993,1,Josh,8005,"Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city; and it will come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them. "
18406,5994,1,Josh,8006,"For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will say, &lsquo;They are fleeing before us as at the first.&rsquo; Therefore we will flee before them. "
18407,5995,1,Josh,8007,"Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand. "
18408,5996,1,Josh,8008,"And it will be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the commandment of the Lord you shall do. See, I have commanded you.&rdquo; "
18409,5997,1,Josh,8009,"Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people. "
18410,5998,1,Josh,8010,"Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. "
18411,5999,1,Josh,8011,"And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai. "
18412,6000,1,Josh,8012,"So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. "
18413,6001,1,Josh,8013,"And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. "
18414,6002,1,Josh,8014,"Now it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. "
18415,6003,1,Josh,8015,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. "
18416,6004,1,Josh,8016,So all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city. 
18417,6005,1,Josh,8017,There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel. 
18418,6006,1,Josh,8018,"Then the Lord said to Joshua, &ldquo;Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.&rdquo; And Joshua stretched out the spear that was in his hand toward the city. "
18419,6007,1,Josh,8019,"So those in ambush arose quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire. "
18420,6008,1,Josh,8020,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven. So they had no power to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers. "
18421,6009,1,Josh,8021,"Now when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. "
18422,6010,1,Josh,8022,"Then the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape. "
18423,6011,1,Josh,8023,"But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. "
18424,6012,1,Josh,8024,"And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. "
18425,6013,1,Josh,8025,"So it was that all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand &ndash; all the people of Ai. "
18426,6014,1,Josh,8026,"For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. "
18427,6015,1,Josh,8027,"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of the Lord which He had commanded Joshua. "
18428,6016,1,Josh,8028,"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day. "
18429,6017,1,Josh,8029,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day. "
18430,6018,1,Josh,8030,"Now Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal, "
18431,6019,1,Josh,8031,"as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: &ldquo;an altar of whole stones over which no man has wielded an iron tool.&rdquo; And they offered on it burnt offerings to the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings. "
18432,6020,1,Josh,8032,"And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. "
18433,6021,1,Josh,8033,"Then all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the stranger as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. "
18434,6022,1,Josh,8034,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. "
18435,6023,1,Josh,8035,"There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the strangers who were living among them. "
18436,6024,1,Josh,9001,"And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side of the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon &ndash; the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite &ndash; heard about it, "
18437,6025,1,Josh,9002,that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one accord. 
18438,6026,1,Josh,9003,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, "
18439,6027,1,Josh,9004,"they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended, "
18440,6028,1,Josh,9005,"old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy. "
18441,6029,1,Josh,9006,"And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, &ldquo;We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.&rdquo; "
18442,6030,1,Josh,9007,"Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites, &ldquo;Perhaps you dwell among us; so how can we make a covenant with you?&rdquo; "
18443,6031,1,Josh,9008,"But they said to Joshua, &ldquo;We are your servants.&rdquo; And Joshua said to them, &ldquo;Who are you, and where do you come from?&rdquo; "
18444,6032,1,Josh,9009,"So they said to him: &ldquo;From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the Lord your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt, "
18445,6033,1,Josh,9010,"and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan &ndash; to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. "
18446,6034,1,Josh,9011,"Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, &lsquo;Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, &ldquo;We are your servants; now therefore, make a covenant with us.&rdquo; &lsquo; "
18447,6035,1,Josh,9012,"This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now look, it is dry and moldy. "
18448,6036,1,Josh,9013,"And these wineskins which we filled were new, and see, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.&rdquo; "
18449,6037,1,Josh,9014,"Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask counsel of the Lord. "
18450,6038,1,Josh,9015,"So Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live; and the rulers of the congregation swore to them. "
18451,6039,1,Josh,9016,"And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors who dwelt near them. "
18452,6040,1,Josh,9017,"Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim. "
18453,6041,1,Josh,9018,"But the children of Israel did not attack them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the rulers. "
18454,6042,1,Josh,9019,"Then all the rulers said to all the congregation, &ldquo;We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel; now therefore, we may not touch them. "
18455,6043,1,Josh,9020,"This we will do to them: We will let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.&rdquo; "
18456,6044,1,Josh,9021,"And the rulers said to them, &ldquo;Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them.&rdquo; "
18457,6045,1,Josh,9022,"Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Why have you deceived us, saying, &lsquo;We are very far from you,&rsquo; when you dwell near us? "
18458,6046,1,Josh,9023,"Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being slaves &ndash; woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.&rdquo; "
18459,6047,1,Josh,9024,"So they answered Joshua and said, &ldquo;Because your servants were clearly told that the Lord your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. "
18460,6048,1,Josh,9025,"And now, here we are, in your hands; do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.&rdquo; "
18461,6049,1,Josh,9026,"So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them. "
18462,6050,1,Josh,9027,"And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord, in the place which He would choose, even to this day. "
18463,6051,1,Josh,10001,"Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it &ndash; as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king &ndash; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, "
18464,6052,1,Josh,10002,"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. "
18465,6053,1,Josh,10003,"Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, "
18466,6054,1,Josh,10004,"Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. "
18467,6055,1,Josh,10005,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it. "
18468,6056,1,Josh,10006,"And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, &ldquo;Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.&rdquo; "
18469,6057,1,Josh,10007,"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. "
18470,6058,1,Josh,10008,"And the Lord said to Joshua, &ldquo;Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.&rdquo; "
18471,6059,1,Josh,10009,"Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal. "
18472,6060,1,Josh,10010,"So the Lord routed them before Israel, killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them along the road that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. "
18473,6061,1,Josh,10011,"And it happened, as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon, that the Lord cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword. "
18474,6062,1,Josh,10012,"Then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel: &ldquo;Sun, stand still over Gibeon; And Moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.&rdquo; "
18475,6063,1,Josh,10013,"So the sun stood still, And the moon stopped, Till the people had revenge Upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day. "
18476,6064,1,Josh,10014,"And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that the Lord heeded the voice of a man; for the Lord fought for Israel. "
18477,6065,1,Josh,10015,"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal. "
18478,6066,1,Josh,10016,But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah. 
18479,6067,1,Josh,10017,"And it was told Joshua, saying, &ldquo;The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.&rdquo; "
18480,6068,1,Josh,10018,"So Joshua said, &ldquo;Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them. "
18481,6069,1,Josh,10019,"And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and attack their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand.&rdquo; "
18482,6070,1,Josh,10020,"Then it happened, while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who escaped entered fortified cities. "
18483,6071,1,Josh,10021,"And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. "
18484,6072,1,Josh,10022,"Then Joshua said, &ldquo;Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.&rdquo; "
18485,6073,1,Josh,10023,"And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. "
18486,6074,1,Josh,10024,"So it was, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, &ldquo;Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.&rdquo; And they drew near and put their feet on their necks. "
18487,6075,1,Josh,10025,"Then Joshua said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.&rdquo; "
18488,6076,1,Josh,10026,"And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening. "
18489,6077,1,Josh,10027,"So it was at the time of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave&rsquo;s mouth, which remain until this very day. "
18490,6078,1,Josh,10028,"On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them* &ndash; all the people who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. "
18491,6079,1,Josh,10029,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah. "
18492,6080,1,Josh,10030,"And the Lord also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho. "
18493,6081,1,Josh,10031,"Then Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it. "
18494,6169,1,Josh,13029,"Moses also had given an inheritance to half the tribe of Manasseh; it was for half the tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families: "
18495,6170,1,Josh,13030,"Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, sixty cities; "
18496,6171,1,Josh,13031,"half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the children of Machir according to their families. "
18497,6172,1,Josh,13032,"These are the areas which Moses had distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho eastward. "
18498,6173,1,Josh,13033,"But to the tribe of Levi Moses had given no inheritance; the Lord God of Israel was their inheritance, as He had said to them. "
18499,6174,1,Josh,14001,"These are the areas which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed as an inheritance to them. "
18500,6175,1,Josh,14002,"Their inheritance was by lot, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. "
18501,6176,1,Josh,14003,"For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them. "
18502,6177,1,Josh,14004,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no part to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their common-lands for their livestock and their property. "
18503,6178,1,Josh,14005,"As the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land. "
18504,6179,1,Josh,14006,"Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: &ldquo;You know the word which the Lord said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea. "
18505,6180,1,Josh,14007,"I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart. "
18506,6181,1,Josh,14008,"Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the Lord my God. "
18507,6182,1,Josh,14009,"So Moses swore on that day, saying, &lsquo;Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children&rsquo;s forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God.&rsquo; "
18508,6183,1,Josh,14010,"And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since the Lord spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old. "
18509,6184,1,Josh,14011,"As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in. "
18510,6185,1,Josh,14012,"Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said.&rdquo; "
18511,6186,1,Josh,14013,"And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. "
18512,6187,1,Josh,14014,"Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. "
18513,6188,1,Josh,14015,And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim). Then the land had rest from war. 
18514,6189,1,Josh,15001,So this was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families: The border of Edom at the Wilderness of Zin southward was the extreme southern boundary.

18516,6191,1,Josh,15003,"Then it went out to the southern side of the Ascent of Akrabbim, passed along to Zin, ascended on the south side of Kadesh Barnea, passed along to Hezron, went up to Adar, and went around to Karkaa. "
18517,6192,1,Josh,15004,"From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the Brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your southern border. "
18518,6193,1,Josh,15005,The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.

18520,6195,1,Josh,15007,"Then the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is before the Ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. The border continued toward the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel. "
18521,6196,1,Josh,15008,"And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusite city (which is Jerusalem). The border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward. "
18522,6197,1,Josh,15009,"Then the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and extended to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Baalah (which is Kirjath Jearim). "
18523,6198,1,Josh,15010,"Then the border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (which is Chesalon), went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed on to Timnah. "

18525,6200,1,Josh,15012,The west border was the coastline of the Great Sea. This is the boundary of the children of Judah all around according to their families. 
18526,6201,1,Josh,15013,"Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a share among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, namely, Kirjath Arba, which is Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak). "
18527,6202,1,Josh,15014,"Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from there: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. "
18528,6203,1,Josh,15015,Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir (formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher). 
18529,6204,1,Josh,15016,"And Caleb said, &ldquo;He who attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.&rdquo; "
18530,6205,1,Josh,15017,"So Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. "
18531,6206,1,Josh,15018,"Now it was so, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; "
18532,6207,1,Josh,15019,"She answered, &ldquo;Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.&rdquo; So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. "

18673,6430,1,Josh,22025,"For the Lord has made the Jordan a border between you and us, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have no part in the Lord.&rdquo; So your descendants would make our descendants cease fearing the Lord.&rsquo; "
18674,6431,1,Josh,22026,"Therefore we said, &lsquo;Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice, "

18707,6464,1,Josh,24009,"&rsquo;Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. "
18708,6465,1,Josh,24010,"&rsquo;But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. So I delivered you out of his hand. "

18721,6478,1,Josh,24023,"Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the Lord God of Israel. "
18722,6479,1,Josh,24024,"And the people said to Joshua, &ldquo;The Lord our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!&rdquo; "
18723,6480,1,Josh,24025,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. "
18724,6481,1,Josh,24026,"Then Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord. "
18725,6482,1,Josh,24027,"And Joshua said to all the people, &ldquo;Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of the Lord which He spoke to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.&rdquo; "
18726,6483,1,Josh,24028,"So Joshua let the people depart, each to his own inheritance. "
18727,6484,1,Josh,24029,"Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred and ten years old. "
18728,6485,1,Josh,24030,"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. "
18729,6486,1,Josh,24031,"Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had known all the works of the Lord which He had done for Israel. "
18730,6487,1,Josh,24032,"The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph. "
18731,6488,1,Josh,24033,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the mountains of Ephraim. "
18732,6489,1,Judg,1001,"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Who shall be first to go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?&rdquo; "
18733,6490,1,Judg,1002,"And the Lord said, &ldquo;Judah shall go up. Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand.&rdquo; "
18734,6491,1,Judg,1003,"So Judah said to Simeon his brother, &ldquo;Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory.&rdquo; And Simeon went with him. "
18735,6492,1,Judg,1004,"Then Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek. "
18736,6493,1,Judg,1005,"And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. "
18737,6494,1,Judg,1006,"Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. "
18738,6495,1,Judg,1007,"And Adoni-Bezek said, &ldquo;Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.&rdquo; Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. "
18739,6496,1,Judg,1008,"Now the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. "
18740,6497,1,Judg,1009,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the South, and in the lowland. "
18741,6498,1,Judg,1010,"Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. "
18742,6499,1,Judg,1011,From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.) 
18743,6500,1,Judg,1012,"Then Caleb said, &ldquo;Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.&rdquo; "
18744,6501,1,Judg,1013,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife. "
18745,6502,1,Judg,1014,"Now it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; "
18746,6503,1,Judg,1015,"So she said to him, &ldquo;Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.&rdquo; And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. "
18747,6504,1,Judg,1016,"Now the children of the Kenite, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which lies in the South near Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people. "
18748,6505,1,Judg,1017,"And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah. "
18749,6506,1,Judg,1018,"Also Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. "
18750,6507,1,Judg,1019,"So the Lord was with Judah. And they drove out the mountaineers, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron. "
18751,6508,1,Judg,1020,"And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he expelled from there the three sons of Anak. "
18752,6509,1,Judg,1021,"But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. "
18753,6510,1,Judg,1022,"And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them. "
18754,6511,1,Judg,1023,So the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.) 
18755,6512,1,Judg,1024,"And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, &ldquo;Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.&rdquo; "
18756,6513,1,Judg,1025,"So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. "
18757,6514,1,Judg,1026,"And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day. "
18758,6515,1,Judg,1027,"However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. "
18759,6516,1,Judg,1028,"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out. "
18760,6517,1,Judg,1029,"Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. "
18761,6518,1,Judg,1030,"Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put under tribute. "
18762,6519,1,Judg,1031,"Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. "
18763,6520,1,Judg,1032,"So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out. "
18764,6521,1,Judg,1033,"Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them. "
18765,6522,1,Judg,1034,"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; "
18766,6523,1,Judg,1035,"and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater, they were put under tribute. "
18767,6524,1,Judg,1036,"Now the boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward. "
18768,6525,1,Judg,2001,"Then the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: &ldquo;I led you up from Egypt and brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers; and I said, &lsquo;I will never break My covenant with you. "
18769,6526,1,Judg,2002,"And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.&rsquo; But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this? "
18770,6527,1,Judg,2003,"Therefore I also said, &lsquo;I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
18771,6528,1,Judg,2004,"So it was, when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept. "
18772,6529,1,Judg,2005,"Then they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the Lord. "
18773,6530,1,Judg,2006,"And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land. "
18774,6531,1,Judg,2007,"So the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord which He had done for Israel. "
18775,6532,1,Judg,2008,"Now Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was one hundred and ten years old. "
18776,6533,1,Judg,2009,"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. "
18777,6534,1,Judg,2010,"When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel. "
18778,6535,1,Judg,2011,"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals; "
18779,6536,1,Judg,2012,"and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked the Lord to anger. "
18780,6537,1,Judg,2013,They forsook the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
18781,6538,1,Judg,2014,"And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel. So He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies. "
18782,6539,1,Judg,2015,"Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for calamity, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed. "
18783,6540,1,Judg,2016,"Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them. "
18784,6541,1,Judg,2017,"Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so. "
18785,6542,1,Judg,2018,"And when the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them. "
18786,6543,1,Judg,2019,"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, by following other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way. "
18787,6544,1,Judg,2020,"Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He said, &ldquo;Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice, "
18788,6545,1,Judg,2021,"I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died, "
18789,6546,1,Judg,2022,"so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the Lord, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.&rdquo; "
18790,6547,1,Judg,2023,"Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua. "
18791,6548,1,Judg,3001,"Now these are the nations which the Lord left, that He might test Israel by them, that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan "
18792,6549,1,Judg,3002,"(this was only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it), "
18793,6550,1,Judg,3003,"namely, five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. "
18794,6551,1,Judg,3004,"And they were left, that He might test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. "
18795,6552,1,Judg,3005,"Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. "
18796,6553,1,Judg,3006,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods. "
18797,6554,1,Judg,3007,"So the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God, and served the Baals and Asherahs."
18798,6555,1,Judg,3008,"Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years. "
18799,6556,1,Judg,3009,"When the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother. "
18800,6557,1,Judg,3010,"The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim. "
18801,6558,1,Judg,3011,So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 
18802,6559,1,Judg,3012,"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord. "
18803,6560,1,Judg,3013,"Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, went and defeated Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms. "
18804,6561,1,Judg,3014,So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years. 
18805,6562,1,Judg,3015,"But when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab. "
18806,6563,1,Judg,3016,Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh. 
18807,6564,1,Judg,3017,So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.) 
18808,6565,1,Judg,3018,"And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. "
18809,6566,1,Judg,3019,"But he himself turned back from the stone images that were at Gilgal, and said, &ldquo;I have a secret message for you, O king.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Keep silence!&rdquo; And all who attended him went out from him. "
18810,6567,1,Judg,3020,"And Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, &ldquo;I have a message from God for you.&rdquo; So he arose from his seat. "
18811,6568,1,Judg,3021,"Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. "
18812,6569,1,Judg,3022,"Even the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out. "
18813,6570,1,Judg,3023,Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them. 
18814,6571,1,Judg,3024,"When he had gone out, Eglon&rsquo;s servants came to look, and to their surprise, the doors of the upper room were locked. So they said, &ldquo;He is probably attending to his needs in the cool chamber.&rdquo; "
18815,6572,1,Judg,3025,"So they waited till they were embarrassed, and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them. And there was their master, fallen dead on the floor. "
18816,6573,1,Judg,3026,"But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah. "
18817,6574,1,Judg,3027,"And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains; and he led them. "
18818,6575,1,Judg,3028,"Then he said to them, &ldquo;Follow me, for the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&rdquo; So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over. "
18819,6576,1,Judg,3029,"And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped. "
18820,6577,1,Judg,3030,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years. 
18821,6578,1,Judg,3031,"After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel. "
18822,6579,1,Judg,4001,"When Ehud was dead, the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord. "
18823,6580,1,Judg,4002,"So the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim. "
18824,6581,1,Judg,4003,"And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord; for Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he harshly oppressed the children of Israel. "
18825,6582,1,Judg,4004,"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time. "
18826,6583,1,Judg,4005,And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
18827,6584,1,Judg,4006,"Then she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, &ldquo;Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded, &lsquo;Go and deploy troops at Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun; "
18828,6690,1,Judg,7017,"And he said to them, &ldquo;Look at me and do likewise; watch, and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do: "
18829,6691,1,Judg,7018,"When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp, and say, &lsquo;The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!&rsquo; &ldquo; "
18830,6692,1,Judg,7019,"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands. "
18831,6693,1,Judg,7020,"Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers &ndash; they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing &ndash; and they cried, &ldquo;The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!&rdquo; "
18832,6694,1,Judg,7021,"And every man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled. "
18833,6695,1,Judg,7022,"When the three hundred blew the trumpets, the Lord set every man&rsquo;s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath. "
18834,6696,1,Judg,7023,"And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites. "
18835,6697,1,Judg,7024,"Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, &ldquo;Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.&rdquo; Then all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan. "
18836,6698,1,Judg,7025,"And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan."
18837,6699,1,Judg,8001,"Now the men of Ephraim said to him, &ldquo;Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?&rdquo; And they reprimanded him sharply. "
18838,6700,1,Judg,8002,"So he said to them, &ldquo;What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? "
18839,6701,1,Judg,8003,"God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?&rdquo; Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that. "
18840,6702,1,Judg,8004,"When Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit. "
18841,6703,1,Judg,8005,"Then he said to the men of Succoth, &ldquo;Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.&rdquo; "
18842,6704,1,Judg,8006,"And the leaders of Succoth said, &ldquo;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?&rdquo; "
18843,6705,1,Judg,8007,"So Gideon said, &ldquo;For this cause, when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!&rdquo; "
18844,6706,1,Judg,8008,Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. 
18845,6707,1,Judg,8009,"So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, &ldquo;When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!&rdquo; "
18846,6708,1,Judg,8010,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen. "
18847,6709,1,Judg,8011,"Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked the army while the camp felt secure. "
18848,6710,1,Judg,8012,"When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army. "
18849,6711,1,Judg,8013,"Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle, from the Ascent of Heres. "
18850,6712,1,Judg,8014,"And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. "
18851,6713,1,Judg,8015,"Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, &ldquo;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you ridiculed me, saying, &lsquo;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?&rsquo; &ldquo; "
18852,6714,1,Judg,8016,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. "
18853,6715,1,Judg,8017,Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city. 
18854,6716,1,Judg,8018,"And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, &ldquo;What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?&rdquo; So they answered, &ldquo;As you are, so were they; each one resembled the son of a king.&rdquo; "
18855,6717,1,Judg,8019,"Then he said, &ldquo;They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.&rdquo; "
18856,6718,1,Judg,8020,"And he said to Jether his firstborn, &ldquo;Rise, kill them!&rdquo; But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth. "
18857,6719,1,Judg,8021,"So Zebah and Zalmunna said, &ldquo;Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength.&rdquo; So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels&rsquo; necks. "
18858,6720,1,Judg,8022,"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, &ldquo;Rule over us, both you and your son, and your grandson also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.&rdquo; "
18859,6721,1,Judg,8023,"But Gideon said to them, &ldquo;I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the Lord shall rule over you.&rdquo; "
18860,6722,1,Judg,8024,"Then Gideon said to them, &ldquo;I would like to make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder.&rdquo; For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites. "
18861,6723,1,Judg,8025,"So they answered, &ldquo;We will gladly give them.&rdquo; And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder. "
18862,6724,1,Judg,8026,"Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were around their camels&rsquo; necks. "
18863,6725,1,Judg,8027,"Then Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel played the harlot with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house. "
18864,6726,1,Judg,8028,"Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon. "
18865,6727,1,Judg,8029,Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
18866,6728,1,Judg,8030,"Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives. "
18867,6729,1,Judg,8031,"And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. "
18868,6730,1,Judg,8032,"Now Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. "
18869,6731,1,Judg,8033,"So it was, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-Berith their god. "
18870,6732,1,Judg,8034,"Thus the children of Israel did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side; "
18871,6733,1,Judg,8035,nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel. 
18872,6734,1,Judg,9001,"Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother&rsquo;s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother&rsquo;s father, saying, "
18873,6735,1,Judg,9002,"Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem: &lsquo;Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you?&rsquo; Remember that I am your own flesh and bone. "
18874,6736,1,Judg,9003,"And his mother&rsquo;s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, &ldquo;He is our brother.&rdquo; "
18875,6737,1,Judg,9004,"So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men; and they followed him. "
18876,6738,1,Judg,9005,"Then he went to his father&rsquo;s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself. "
18877,6739,1,Judg,9006,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, all of Beth Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that was in Shechem. "
18878,6740,1,Judg,9007,"Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them: &ldquo;Listen to me, you men of Shechem, That God may listen to you! "
18879,6741,1,Judg,9008,"The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, &lsquo;Reign over us!&rsquo; "
18880,6742,1,Judg,9009,"But the olive tree said to them, &lsquo;Should I cease giving my oil, With which they honor God and men, And go to sway over trees?&rsquo; "
18881,6743,1,Judg,9010,"Then the trees said to the fig tree, &lsquo;You come and reign over us!&rsquo; "
18882,6744,1,Judg,9011,"But the fig tree said to them, &lsquo;Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit, And go to sway over trees?&rsquo; "
18883,6745,1,Judg,9012,"Then the trees said to the vine, &lsquo;You come and reign over us!&rsquo; "
18884,6746,1,Judg,9013,"But the vine said to them, &lsquo;Should I cease my new wine, Which cheers both God and men, And go to sway over trees?&rsquo; "
18885,6747,1,Judg,9014,"Then all the trees said to the bramble, &lsquo;You come and reign over us!&rsquo; "
18886,6748,1,Judg,9015,"And the bramble said to the trees, &lsquo;If in truth you anoint me as king over you, Then come and take shelter in my shade; But if not, let fire come out of the bramble And devour the cedars of Lebanon!&rsquo; "
18887,6749,1,Judg,9016,"Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as he deserves &ndash; "
18888,6750,1,Judg,9017,"for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian; "
18889,6751,1,Judg,9018,"but you have risen up against my father&rsquo;s house this day, and killed his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother &ndash; "
18890,6752,1,Judg,9019,"if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. "
18891,6753,1,Judg,9020,"But if not, let fire come from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and Beth Millo; and let fire come from the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and devour Abimelech! "
18892,6754,1,Judg,9021,"And Jotham ran away and fled; and he went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. "
18893,6755,1,Judg,9022,"After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years, "
18894,6756,1,Judg,9023,"God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, "
18895,6757,1,Judg,9024,"that the crime done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brothers. "
18896,6758,1,Judg,9025,"And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech. "
18897,6759,1,Judg,9026,"Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. "
18898,6760,1,Judg,9027,"So they went out into the fields, and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and made merry. And they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. "
18899,6761,1,Judg,9028,"Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, &ldquo;Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? "
18900,6762,1,Judg,9029,"If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.&rdquo; So he said to Abimelech, &ldquo;Increase your army and come out!&rdquo; "
18901,6763,1,Judg,9030,"When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused. "
18902,6764,1,Judg,9031,"And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, &ldquo;Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you. "
18903,6765,1,Judg,9032,"Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. "
18904,6766,1,Judg,9033,"And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, that you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may then do to them as you find opportunity.&rdquo; "
18905,6767,1,Judg,9034,"So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. "
18906,6768,1,Judg,9035,"When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait. "
18907,6769,1,Judg,9036,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, &ldquo;Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!&rdquo; But Zebul said to him, &ldquo;You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.&rdquo; "
18908,6770,1,Judg,9037,"So Gaal spoke again and said, &ldquo;See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the Diviners&rsquo; Terebinth Tree.&rdquo; "
18909,6771,1,Judg,9038,"Then Zebul said to him, &ldquo;Where indeed is your mouth now, with which you said, &lsquo;Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?&rsquo; Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out, if you will, and fight with them now.&rdquo; "
18910,6772,1,Judg,9039,"So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. "
18911,6773,1,Judg,9040,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the very entrance of the gate. "
18912,6774,1,Judg,9041,"Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem. "
18913,6775,1,Judg,9042,"And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech. "
18914,6776,1,Judg,9043,"So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and attacked them. "
18915,6777,1,Judg,9044,"Then Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and killed them. "
18916,6778,1,Judg,9045,"So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city and killed the people who were in it; and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt. "
18917,6779,1,Judg,9046,"Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard that, they entered the stronghold of the temple of the god Berith. "
18918,6780,1,Judg,9047,And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
18919,6781,1,Judg,9048,"Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder; then he said to the people who were with him, &ldquo;What you have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.&rdquo; "
18920,6782,1,Judg,9049,"So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women. "
18921,6783,1,Judg,9050,"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it. "
18922,6784,1,Judg,9051,"But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women &ndash; all the people of the city &ndash; fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower. "
18923,6785,1,Judg,9052,"So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire. "
18924,6786,1,Judg,9053,"But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech&rsquo;s head and crushed his skull. "
18925,6787,1,Judg,9054,"Then he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, &ldquo;Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, &lsquo;A woman killed him.&rsquo; &ldquo; So his young man thrust him through, and he died. "
18926,6788,1,Judg,9055,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place. "
18927,6789,1,Judg,9056,"Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. "
18928,6790,1,Judg,9057,"And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. "
18929,6791,1,Judg,10001,"After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim. "
18930,6792,1,Judg,10002,"He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir. "
18931,6793,1,Judg,10003,"After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years. "
18932,6794,1,Judg,10004,"Now he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys; they also had thirty towns, which are called &ldquo;Havoth Jair&rdquo; to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. "
18933,6795,1,Judg,10005,And Jair died and was buried in Camon. 
18934,6796,1,Judg,10006,"Then the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the Lord and did not serve Him. "
18935,6797,1,Judg,10007,"So the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the people of Ammon. "
18936,6798,1,Judg,10008,"From that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years &ndash; all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, in Gilead. "
18937,6799,1,Judg,10009,"Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed. "
18938,6800,1,Judg,10010,"And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;We have sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals!&rdquo; "
18939,6801,1,Judg,10011,"So the Lord said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites and from the people of Ammon and from the Philistines? "
18940,6802,1,Judg,10012,"Also the Sidonians and Amalekites and Maonites oppressed you; and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand. "
18941,6803,1,Judg,10013,Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more. 
18942,6804,1,Judg,10014,"Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.&rdquo; "
18943,6805,1,Judg,10015,"And the children of Israel said to the Lord, &ldquo;We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems best to You; only deliver us this day, we pray.&rdquo; "
18944,6806,1,Judg,10016,So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord. And His soul could no longer endure the misery of Israel. 
18945,6807,1,Judg,10017,Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah. 
18946,6808,1,Judg,10018,"And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, &ldquo;Who is the man who will begin the fight against the people of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.&rdquo; "
18947,6809,1,Judg,11001,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah. "
18948,6810,1,Judg,11002,"Gilead&rsquo;s wife bore sons; and when his wife&rsquo;s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, &ldquo;You shall have no inheritance in our father&rsquo;s house, for you are the son of another woman.&rdquo; "
18949,6811,1,Judg,11003,"Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out raiding with him. "
18950,6812,1,Judg,11004,It came to pass after a time that the people of Ammon made war against Israel. 
18951,6813,1,Judg,11005,"And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. "
18952,6814,1,Judg,11006,"Then they said to Jephthah, &ldquo;Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.&rdquo; "
18953,6815,1,Judg,11007,"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, &ldquo;Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father&rsquo;s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?&rdquo; "
18954,6816,1,Judg,11008,"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &ldquo;That is why we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.&rdquo; "
18955,6817,1,Judg,11009,"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, &ldquo;If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the Lord delivers them to me, shall I be your head?&rdquo; "
18956,6818,1,Judg,11010,"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &ldquo;The Lord will be a witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.&rdquo; "
18957,6819,1,Judg,11011,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah. "
18958,6820,1,Judg,11012,"Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, &ldquo;What do you have against me, that you have come to fight against me in my land?&rdquo; "
18959,6821,1,Judg,11013,"And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, &ldquo;Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those lands peaceably.&rdquo; "
18960,6822,1,Judg,11014,"So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, "
18961,6823,1,Judg,11015,"and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Jephthah: &lsquo;Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon; "
18962,6824,1,Judg,11016,"for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. "
18963,6825,1,Judg,11017,"Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, &ldquo;Please let me pass through your land.&rdquo; But the king of Edom would not heed. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained in Kadesh. "
18964,6826,1,Judg,11018,"And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. "
18965,6827,1,Judg,11019,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, &ldquo;Please let us pass through your land into our place.&rdquo; "
18966,6828,1,Judg,11020,"But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. "
18967,6829,1,Judg,11021,"And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country. "
18968,6830,1,Judg,11022,"They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. "
18969,6831,1,Judg,11023,"And now the Lord God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel; should you then possess it? "
18970,6832,1,Judg,11024,"Will you not possess whatever Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the Lord our God takes possession of before us, we will possess. "
18971,6833,1,Judg,11025,"And now, are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them? "
18972,6834,1,Judg,11026,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time? "
18973,6835,1,Judg,11027,"Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you wronged me by fighting against me. May the Lord, the Judge, render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
18974,6836,1,Judg,11028,"However, the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him. "
18975,6837,1,Judg,11029,"Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon. "
18976,6838,1,Judg,11030,"And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord, and said, &ldquo;If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands, "
18977,6839,1,Judg,11031,"then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord&rsquo;s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.&rdquo; "
18978,6840,1,Judg,11032,"So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hands. "
18979,6841,1,Judg,11033,"And he defeated them from Aroer as far as Minnith &ndash; twenty cities &ndash; and to Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter. Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. "
18980,6842,1,Judg,11034,"When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, there was his daughter, coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing; and she was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter. "
18981,6843,1,Judg,11035,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, &ldquo;Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it.&rdquo; "
18982,6844,1,Judg,11036,"So she said to him, &ldquo;My father, if you have given your word to the Lord, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon.&rdquo; "
18983,6845,1,Judg,11037,"Then she said to her father, &ldquo;Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I.&rdquo; "
18984,6846,1,Judg,11038,"So he said, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; And he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains. "
18985,6847,1,Judg,11039,"And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he carried out his vow with her which he had vowed. She knew no man. And it became a custom in Israel "
18986,6848,1,Judg,11040,that the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite. 
18987,6849,1,Judg,12001,"Then the men of Ephraim gathered together, crossed over toward Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, &ldquo;Why did you cross over to fight against the people of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you with fire!&rdquo; "
18988,6850,1,Judg,12002,"And Jephthah said to them, &ldquo;My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands. "
18989,6851,1,Judg,12003,"So when I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon; and the Lord delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?&rdquo; "
18990,6852,1,Judg,12004,"Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, &ldquo;You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.&rdquo; "
18991,6853,1,Judg,12005,"The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived. And when any Ephraimite who escaped said, &ldquo;Let me cross over,&rdquo; the men of Gilead would say to him, &ldquo;Are you an Ephraimite?&rdquo; If he said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; "
18992,6854,1,Judg,12006,"then they would say to him, &ldquo;Then say, &lsquo;Shibboleth&rsquo;!&rdquo; And he would say, &ldquo;Sibboleth,&rdquo; for he could not pronounce it right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites. "
18993,6855,1,Judg,12007,And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in among the cities of Gilead. 
18994,6856,1,Judg,12008,"After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. "
18995,6857,1,Judg,12009,"He had thirty sons. And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage, and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons. He judged Israel seven years. "
18996,6858,1,Judg,12010,Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem. 
18997,6859,1,Judg,12011,"After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years. "
18998,6860,1,Judg,12012,And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. 
18999,6861,1,Judg,12013,"After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. "
19000,6862,1,Judg,12014,"He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. He judged Israel eight years. "
19001,6863,1,Judg,12015,"Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains of the Amalekites. "
19002,6864,1,Judg,13001,"Again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years. "
19003,6865,1,Judg,13002,"Now there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children. "
19004,6866,1,Judg,13003,"And the Angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, &ldquo;Indeed now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. "
19005,6867,1,Judg,13004,"Now therefore, please be careful not to drink wine or similar drink, and not to eat anything unclean. "
19006,6868,1,Judg,13005,"For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo; "
19007,6869,1,Judg,13006,"So the woman came and told her husband, saying, &ldquo;A Man of God came to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name. "
19008,6870,1,Judg,13007,"And He said to me, &lsquo;Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19009,6871,1,Judg,13008,"Then Manoah prayed to the Lord, and said, &ldquo;O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born.&rdquo; "
19010,6872,1,Judg,13009,"And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her. "
19011,6873,1,Judg,13010,"Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, &ldquo;Look, the Man who came to me the other day has just now appeared to me!&rdquo; "
19012,6874,1,Judg,13011,"So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, &ldquo;Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; "
19013,6875,1,Judg,13012,"Manoah said, &ldquo;Now let Your words come to pass! What will be the boy&rsquo;s rule of life, and his work?&rdquo; "
19014,6876,1,Judg,13013,"So the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, &ldquo;Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful. "
19015,6877,1,Judg,13014,"She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor may she drink wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I commanded her let her observe.&rdquo; "
19016,6878,1,Judg,13015,"Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, &ldquo;Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.&rdquo; "
19017,6879,1,Judg,13016,"And the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, &ldquo;Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the Lord.&rdquo; (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the Lord.) "
19018,6880,1,Judg,13017,"Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, &ldquo;What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?&rdquo; "
19019,6881,1,Judg,13018,"And the Angel of the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?&rdquo; "
19020,6882,1,Judg,13019,"So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the Lord. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on &ndash; "
19021,6883,1,Judg,13020,"it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar &ndash; the Angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar! When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground. "
19022,6884,1,Judg,13021,"When the Angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of the Lord. "
19023,6885,1,Judg,13022,"And Manoah said to his wife, &ldquo;We shall surely die, because we have seen God!&rdquo; "
19024,6886,1,Judg,13023,"But his wife said to him, &ldquo;If the Lord had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.&rdquo; "
19025,6887,1,Judg,13024,"So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him. "
19026,6888,1,Judg,13025,And the Spirit of the Lord began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. 
19027,6889,1,Judg,14001,"Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. "
19028,6890,1,Judg,14002,"So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, &ldquo;I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.&rdquo; "
19029,6891,1,Judg,14003,"Then his father and mother said to him, &ldquo;Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?&rdquo; And Samson said to his father, &ldquo;Get her for me, for she pleases me well.&rdquo; "
19030,6892,1,Judg,14004,"But his father and mother did not know that it was of the Lord &ndash; that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. "
19031,6893,1,Judg,14005,"So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah.Now to his surprise, a young lion came roaring against him. "
19032,6894,1,Judg,14006,"And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. "
19033,6895,1,Judg,14007,"Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. "
19034,6896,1,Judg,14008,"After some time, when he returned to get her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion. "
19035,6897,1,Judg,14009,"He took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion. "
19036,6898,1,Judg,14010,"So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men used to do so. "
19037,6899,1,Judg,14011,"And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. "
19038,6900,1,Judg,14012,"Then Samson said to them, &ldquo;Let me pose a riddle to you. If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. "
19039,6901,1,Judg,14013,"But if you cannot explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.&rdquo; And they said to him, &ldquo;Pose your riddle, that we may hear it.&rdquo; "
19040,6902,1,Judg,14014,"So he said to them: &ldquo;Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet.&rdquo; Now for three days they could not explain the riddle. "
19041,6903,1,Judg,14015,"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Entice your husband, that he may explain the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your father&rsquo;s house with fire. Have you invited us in order to take what is ours? Is that not so?&rdquo; "
19042,6904,1,Judg,14016,"Then Samson&rsquo;s wife wept on him, and said, &ldquo;You only hate me! You do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;Look, I have not explained it to my father or my mother; so should I explain it to you?&rdquo; "
19043,6905,1,Judg,14017,"Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people. "
19044,6906,1,Judg,14018,"So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down: &ldquo;What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?&rdquo; And he said to them: &ldquo;If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have solved my riddle!&rdquo; "
19045,6907,1,Judg,14019,"Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle. So his anger was aroused, and he went back up to his father&rsquo;s house. "
19046,6908,1,Judg,14020,"And Samson&rsquo;s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man. "
19047,6909,1,Judg,15001,"After a while, in the time of wheat harvest, it happened that Samson visited his wife with a young goat. And he said, &ldquo;Let me go in to my wife, into her room.&rdquo; But her father would not permit him to go in. "
19048,6910,1,Judg,15002,"Her father said, &ldquo;I really thought that you thoroughly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.&rdquo; "
19049,6911,1,Judg,15003,"And Samson said to them, &ldquo;This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!&rdquo; "
19050,6912,1,Judg,15004,"Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails. "
19051,6913,1,Judg,15005,"When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves. "
19052,6914,1,Judg,15006,"Then the Philistines said, &ldquo;Who has done this?&rdquo; And they answered, &ldquo;Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.&rdquo; So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. "
19053,6915,1,Judg,15007,"Samson said to them, &ldquo;Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.&rdquo; "
19054,6916,1,Judg,15008,"So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam. "
19055,6917,1,Judg,15009,"Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves against Lehi. "
19056,6918,1,Judg,15010,"And the men of Judah said, &ldquo;Why have you come up against us?&rdquo; So they answered, &ldquo;We have come up to arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.&rdquo; "
19057,6919,1,Judg,15011,"Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, &ldquo;Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;As they did to me, so I have done to them.&rdquo; "
19058,6920,1,Judg,15012,"But they said to him, &ldquo;We have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo; Then Samson said to them, &ldquo;Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.&rdquo; "
19059,6921,1,Judg,15013,"So they spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.&rdquo; And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock. "
19060,6922,1,Judg,15014,"When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds broke loose from his hands. "
19061,6923,1,Judg,15015,"He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it. "
19062,6924,1,Judg,15016,"Then Samson said: &ldquo;With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!&rdquo; "
19063,6925,1,Judg,15017,"And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi."
19064,6926,1,Judg,15018,"Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the Lord and said, &ldquo;You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?&rdquo; "
19065,6927,1,Judg,15019,"So God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. "
19066,6928,1,Judg,15020,And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines. 
19067,6929,1,Judg,16001,"Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her. "
19068,6930,1,Judg,16002,"When the Gazites were told, &ldquo;Samson has come here!&rdquo; they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They were quiet all night, saying, &ldquo;In the morning, when it is daylight, we will kill him.&rdquo; "
19069,6931,1,Judg,16003,"And Samson lay low till midnight; then he arose at midnight, took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron. "
19070,6932,1,Judg,16004,"Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. "
19071,6933,1,Judg,16005,"And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, &ldquo;Entice him, and find out where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.&rdquo; "
19072,6934,1,Judg,16006,"So Delilah said to Samson, &ldquo;Please tell me where your great strength lies, and with what you may be bound to afflict you.&rdquo; "
19073,6935,1,Judg,16007,"And Samson said to her, &ldquo;If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.&rdquo; "
19074,6936,1,Judg,16008,"So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, and she bound him with them. "
19075,6937,1,Judg,16009,"Now men were lying in wait, staying with her in the room. And she said to him, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; But he broke the bowstrings as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not known. "
19076,6938,1,Judg,16010,"Then Delilah said to Samson, &ldquo;Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me what you may be bound with.&rdquo; "
19077,6939,1,Judg,16011,"So he said to her, &ldquo;If they bind me securely with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.&rdquo; "
19078,6940,1,Judg,16012,"Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; And men were lying in wait, staying in the room. But he broke them off his arms like a thread. "
19079,6941,1,Judg,16013,"Delilah said to Samson, &ldquo;Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me what you may be bound with.&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom&rdquo; &ndash; "
19080,6942,1,Judg,16014,"So she wove it tightly with the batten of the loom, and said to him, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled out the batten and the web from the loom. "
19081,6943,1,Judg,16015,"Then she said to him, &ldquo;How can you say, &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.&rdquo; "
19082,6944,1,Judg,16016,"And it came to pass, when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him, so that his soul was vexed to death, "
19083,6945,1,Judg,16017,"that he told her all his heart, and said to her, &ldquo;No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother&rsquo;s womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.&rdquo; "
19084,6946,1,Judg,16018,"When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, &ldquo;Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart.&rdquo; So the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand. "
19085,6947,1,Judg,16019,"Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. "
19086,6948,1,Judg,16020,"And she said, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; So he awoke from his sleep, and said, &ldquo;I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!&rdquo; But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him. "
19087,6949,1,Judg,16021,"Then the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze fetters, and he became a grinder in the prison. "
19088,6950,1,Judg,16022,"However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven. "
19089,6951,1,Judg,16023,"Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. And they said: &ldquo;Our god has delivered into our hands Samson our enemy!&rdquo; "
19090,6952,1,Judg,16024,"When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said: &ldquo;Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, The destroyer of our land, And the one who multiplied our dead.&rdquo; "
19091,6953,1,Judg,16025,"So it happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, &ldquo;Call for Samson, that he may perform for us.&rdquo; So they called for Samson from the prison, and he performed for them. And they stationed him between the pillars. "
19092,6954,1,Judg,16026,"Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, &ldquo;Let me feel the pillars which support the temple, so that I can lean on them.&rdquo; "
19093,6955,1,Judg,16027,"Now the temple was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there &ndash; about three thousand men and women on the roof watching while Samson performed. "
19094,6956,1,Judg,16028,"Then Samson called to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;O Lord God, remember me, I pray! Strengthen me, I pray, just this once, O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!&rdquo; "
19095,6957,1,Judg,16029,"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple, and he braced himself against them, one on his right and the other on his left. "
19096,6958,1,Judg,16030,"Then Samson said, &ldquo;Let me die with the Philistines!&rdquo; And he pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life. "
19097,6959,1,Judg,16031,"And his brothers and all his father&rsquo;s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had judged Israel twenty years. "
19098,6960,1,Judg,17001,"Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. "
19099,6961,1,Judg,17002,"And he said to his mother, &ldquo;The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, and on which you put a curse, even saying it in my ears &ndash; here is the silver with me; I took it.&rdquo; And his mother said, &ldquo;May you be blessed by the Lord, my son!&rdquo; "
19100,6962,1,Judg,17003,"So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, &ldquo;I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the Lord for my son, to make a carved image and a molded image; now therefore, I will return it to you.&rdquo; "
19101,6963,1,Judg,17004,"Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a carved image and a molded image; and they were in the house of Micah. "
19102,6964,1,Judg,17005,"The man Micah had a shrine, and made an ephod and household idols; and he consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. "
19103,6965,1,Judg,17006,"In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. "
19104,6966,1,Judg,17007,"Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he was a Levite, and was staying there. "
19105,6967,1,Judg,17008,"The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find a place. Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. "
19106,6968,1,Judg,17009,"And Micah said to him, &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; So he said to him, &ldquo;I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to stay.&rdquo; "
19107,6969,1,Judg,17010,"Micah said to him, &ldquo;Dwell with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance.&rdquo; So the Levite went in. "
19108,6970,1,Judg,17011,"Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him. "
19109,6971,1,Judg,17012,"So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and lived in the house of Micah. "
19110,6972,1,Judg,17013,"Then Micah said, &ldquo;Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, since I have a Levite as priest!&rdquo; "
19111,6973,1,Judg,18001,"In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in; for until that day their inheritance among the tribes of Israel had not fallen to them. "
19112,6974,1,Judg,18002,"So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and search it. They said to them, &ldquo;Go, search the land.&rdquo; So they went to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. "
19113,6975,1,Judg,18003,"While they were at the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. They turned aside and said to him, &ldquo;Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?&rdquo; "
19114,6976,1,Judg,18004,"He said to them, &ldquo;Thus and so Micah did for me. He has hired me, and I have become his priest.&rdquo; "
19115,6977,1,Judg,18005,"So they said to him, &ldquo;Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous.&rdquo; "
19116,6978,1,Judg,18006,"And the priest said to them, &ldquo;Go in peace. The presence of the Lord be with you on your way.&rdquo; "
19117,6979,1,Judg,18007,"So the five men departed and went to Laish. They saw the people who were there, how they dwelt safely, in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure. There were no rulers in the land who might put them to shame for anything. They were far from the Sidonians, and they had no ties with anyone."
19118,6980,1,Judg,18008,"Then the spies came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, &ldquo;What is your report?&rdquo; "
19119,6981,1,Judg,18009,"So they said, &ldquo;Arise, let us go up against them. For we have seen the land, and indeed it is very good. Would you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, and enter to possess the land. "
19120,6982,1,Judg,18010,"When you go, you will come to a secure people and a large land. For God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.&rdquo; "
19121,6983,1,Judg,18011,"And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there, from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. "
19122,6984,1,Judg,18012,"Then they went up and encamped in Kirjath Jearim in Judah. (Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. There it is, west of Kirjath Jearim.) "
19123,6985,1,Judg,18013,"And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah. "
19124,6986,1,Judg,18014,"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren, &ldquo;Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, household idols, a carved image, and a molded image? Now therefore, consider what you should do.&rdquo; "
19125,6987,1,Judg,18015,"So they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man &ndash; to the house of Micah &ndash; and greeted him. "
19126,6988,1,Judg,18016,"The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. "
19127,6989,1,Judg,18017,"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up. Entering there, they took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image. The priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were armed with weapons of war. "
19128,6990,1,Judg,18018,"When these went into Micah&rsquo;s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image, the priest said to them, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; "
19129,6991,1,Judg,18019,"And they said to him, &ldquo;Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?&rdquo; "
19130,6992,1,Judg,18020,"So the priest&rsquo;s heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and took his place among the people. "
19131,6993,1,Judg,18021,"Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them. "
19132,6994,1,Judg,18022,"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah&rsquo;s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan. "
19133,6995,1,Judg,18023,"And they called out to the children of Dan. So they turned around and said to Micah, &ldquo;What ails you, that you have gathered such a company?&rdquo; "
19134,6996,1,Judg,18024,"So he said, &ldquo;You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you have gone away. Now what more do I have? How can you say to me, &lsquo;What ails you?&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19135,6997,1,Judg,18025,"And the children of Dan said to him, &ldquo;Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household!&rdquo; "
19136,6998,1,Judg,18026,"Then the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house. "
19137,6999,1,Judg,18027,"So they took the things Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. "
19138,7000,1,Judg,18028,"There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no ties with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there. "
19139,7001,1,Judg,18029,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However, the name of the city formerly was Laish. "
19140,7002,1,Judg,18030,"Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. "
19141,7003,1,Judg,18031,"So they set up for themselves Micah&rsquo;s carved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. "
19142,7004,1,Judg,19001,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote mountains of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. "
19143,7005,1,Judg,19002,"But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father&rsquo;s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months. "
19144,7006,1,Judg,19003,"Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father&rsquo;s house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him. "
19145,7007,1,Judg,19004,"Now his father-in-law, the young woman&rsquo;s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there. "
19146,7008,1,Judg,19005,"Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he stood to depart; but the young woman&rsquo;s father said to his son-in-law, &ldquo;Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.&rdquo; "
19147,7009,1,Judg,19006,"So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman&rsquo;s father said to the man, &ldquo;Please be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.&rdquo; "
19148,7010,1,Judg,19007,"And when the man stood to depart, his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again. "
19149,7011,1,Judg,19008,"Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;Please refresh your heart.&rdquo; So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate. "
19150,7012,1,Judg,19009,"And when the man stood to depart &ndash; he and his concubine and his servant &ndash; his father-in-law, the young woman&rsquo;s father, said to him, &ldquo;Look, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. See, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry. Tomorrow go your way early, so that you may get home.&rdquo; "
19151,7013,1,Judg,19010,"However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose and departed, and came to opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him. "
19152,7014,1,Judg,19011,"They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, &ldquo;Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.&rdquo; "
19153,7015,1,Judg,19012,"But his master said to him, &ldquo;We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.&rdquo; "
19154,7016,1,Judg,19013,"So he said to his servant, &ldquo;Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.&rdquo; "
19155,7017,1,Judg,19014,"And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. "
19156,7018,1,Judg,19015,"They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no one would take them into his house to spend the night. "
19157,7019,1,Judg,19016,"Just then an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was staying in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites. "
19158,7020,1,Judg,19017,"And when he raised his eyes, he saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, &ldquo;Where are you going, and where do you come from?&rdquo; "
19159,7021,1,Judg,19018,"So he said to him, &ldquo;We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of the Lord. But there is no one who will take me into his house, "
19160,7022,1,Judg,19019,"although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your female servant, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.&rdquo; "
19161,7023,1,Judg,19020,"And the old man said, &ldquo;Peace be with you! However, let all your needs be my responsibility; only do not spend the night in the open square.&rdquo; "
19162,7024,1,Judg,19021,"So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank. "
19163,7025,1,Judg,19022,"As they were enjoying themselves, suddenly certain men of the city, perverted men, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, &ldquo;Bring out the man who came to your house, that we may know him carnally!&rdquo; "
19164,7026,1,Judg,19023,"But the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, &ldquo;No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not commit this outrage. "
19165,7027,1,Judg,19024,"Look, here is my virgin daughter and the man&rsquo;s concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them as you please; but to this man do not do such a vile thing!&rdquo; "
19166,7028,1,Judg,19025,"But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go. "
19167,7029,1,Judg,19026,"Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man&rsquo;s house where her master was, till it was light. "
19168,7030,1,Judg,19027,"When her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, there was his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold. "
19169,7031,1,Judg,19028,"And he said to her, &ldquo;Get up and let us be going.&rdquo; But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man got up and went to his place. "
19170,7032,1,Judg,19029,"When he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. "
19171,7033,1,Judg,19030,"And so it was that all who saw it said, &ldquo;No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, confer, and speak up!&rdquo; "
19172,7122,1,Ruth,1016,"But Ruth said: &ldquo;Entreat me not to leave you, Or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God. "
19173,7123,1,Ruth,1017,"Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more also, If anything but death parts you and me.&rdquo; "
19174,7124,1,Ruth,1018,"When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her. "
19175,7125,1,Ruth,1019,"Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was excited because of them; and the women said, &ldquo;Is this Naomi?&rdquo; "
19176,7126,1,Ruth,1020,"But she said to them, &ldquo;Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. "
19177,7127,1,Ruth,1021,"I went out full, and the Lord has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the Lord has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?&rdquo; "
19178,7128,1,Ruth,1022,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest. "
19179,7129,1,Ruth,2001,"There was a relative of Naomi&rsquo;s husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz. "
19180,7130,1,Ruth,2002,"So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, &ldquo;Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor.&rdquo; And she said to her, &ldquo;Go, my daughter.&rdquo; "
19181,7131,1,Ruth,2003,"Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. "
19182,7132,1,Ruth,2004,"Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, &ldquo;The Lord be with you!&rdquo; And they answered him, &ldquo;The Lord bless you!&rdquo; "
19183,7133,1,Ruth,2005,"Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, &ldquo;Whose young woman is this?&rdquo; "
19184,7134,1,Ruth,2006,"So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, &ldquo;It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. "
19185,7135,1,Ruth,2007,"And she said, &lsquo;Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.&rsquo; So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.&rdquo; "
19186,7136,1,Ruth,2008,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, &ldquo;You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women. "
19187,7137,1,Ruth,2009,"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.&rdquo; "
19188,7138,1,Ruth,2010,"So she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, &ldquo;Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?&rdquo; "
19189,7139,1,Ruth,2011,"And Boaz answered and said to her, &ldquo;It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before. "
19190,7140,1,Ruth,2012,"The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.&rdquo; "
19191,7141,1,Ruth,2013,"Then she said, &ldquo;Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.&rdquo; "
19192,7142,1,Ruth,2014,"Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, &ldquo;Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.&rdquo; So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched grain to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and kept some back. "
19193,7143,1,Ruth,2015,"And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, &ldquo;Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. "
19194,7144,1,Ruth,2016,"Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.&rdquo; "
19195,7145,1,Ruth,2017,"So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. "
19196,7146,1,Ruth,2018,"Then she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied. "
19197,7147,1,Ruth,2019,"And her mother-in-law said to her, &ldquo;Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.&rdquo; So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.&rdquo; "
19198,7148,1,Ruth,2020,"Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;Blessed be he of the Lord, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!&rdquo; And Naomi said to her, &ldquo;This man is a relation of ours, one of our close relatives.&rdquo; "
19199,7149,1,Ruth,2021,"Ruth the Moabitess said, &ldquo;He also said to me, &lsquo;You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19200,7150,1,Ruth,2022,"And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not meet you in any other field.&rdquo; "
19201,7151,1,Ruth,2023,"So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law. "
19202,7152,1,Ruth,3001,"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, &ldquo;My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you? "
19203,7153,1,Ruth,3002,"Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. "
19204,7154,1,Ruth,3003,"Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, put on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. "
19205,7155,1,Ruth,3004,"Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.&rdquo; "
19206,7156,1,Ruth,3005,"And she said to her, &ldquo;All that you say to me I will do.&rdquo; "
19207,7157,1,Ruth,3006,So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her. 
19208,7158,1,Ruth,3007,"And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. "
19209,7159,1,Ruth,3008,"Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and there, a woman was lying at his feet. "
19210,7160,1,Ruth,3009,"And he said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; So she answered, &ldquo;I am Ruth, your maidservant. Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are a close relative.&rdquo; "
19211,7161,1,Ruth,3010,"Then he said, &ldquo;Blessed are you of the Lord, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich. "
19212,7162,1,Ruth,3011,"And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman. "
19213,7163,1,Ruth,3012,"Now it is true that I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I. "
19214,7164,1,Ruth,3013,"Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be that if he will perform the duty of a close relative for you &ndash; good; let him do it. But if he does not want to perform the duty for you, then I will perform the duty for you, as the Lord lives! Lie down until morning.&rdquo; "
19215,7165,1,Ruth,3014,"So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. Then he said, &ldquo;Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.&rdquo; "
19216,7166,1,Ruth,3015,"Also he said, &ldquo;Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it.&rdquo; And when she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. Then she went into the city. "
19217,7167,1,Ruth,3016,"So when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, &ldquo;Is that you, my daughter?&rdquo; Then she told her all that the man had done for her. "

19220,7170,1,Ruth,4001,"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz had spoken came by. So Boaz said, &ldquo;Come aside, friend,* sit down here.&rdquo; So he came aside and sat down. "

19226,7176,1,Ruth,4007,"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation in Israel. "
19227,7177,1,Ruth,4008,"Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, &ldquo;Buy it for yourself.&rdquo; So he took off his sandal. "
19228,7178,1,Ruth,4009,"And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, &ldquo;You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech&rsquo;s, and all that was Chilion&rsquo;s and Mahlon&rsquo;s, from the hand of Naomi. "
19229,7179,1,Ruth,4010,"Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day.&rdquo; "
19230,7180,1,Ruth,4011,"And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, &ldquo;We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. "
19231,7181,1,Ruth,4012,"May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the Lord will give you from this young woman.&rdquo; "

19343,7574,1,1Kg,15035,"And Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel. "
19344,7575,1,1Kg,16001,"Now the Lord said to Samuel, &ldquo;How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided Myself a king among his sons.&rdquo; "

19348,7579,1,1Kg,16005,"And he said, &ldquo;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&rdquo; Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice. "
19349,7580,1,1Kg,16006,"So it was, when they came, that he looked at Eliab and said, &ldquo;Surely the Lord&rsquo;s anointed is before Him.&rdquo; "

19358,7589,1,1Kg,16015,"And Saul&rsquo;s servants said to him, &ldquo;Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you. "

19589,7857,1,1Kg,25017,"Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.&rdquo; "
19590,7858,1,1Kg,25018,"Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already dressed, five seahs of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys. "
19591,7859,1,1Kg,25019,"And she said to her servants, &ldquo;Go on before me; see, I am coming after you.&rdquo; But she did not tell her husband Nabal. "

19598,7866,1,1Kg,25026,"Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, since the Lord has held you back from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now then, let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal. "
19599,7867,1,1Kg,25027,"And now this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord. "
19600,7868,1,1Kg,25028,"Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord fights the battles of the Lord, and evil is not found in you throughout your days. "
19601,7869,1,1Kg,25029,"Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling. "

19604,7872,1,1Kg,25032,"Then David said to Abigail: &ldquo;Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! "
19605,7873,1,1Kg,25033,"And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand. "

19741,7934,1,1Kg,28013,"And the king said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. What did you see?&rdquo; And the woman said to Saul, &ldquo;I saw a spirit ascending out of the earth.&rdquo; "
19742,7935,1,1Kg,28014,"So he said to her, &ldquo;What is his form?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;An old man is coming up, and he is covered with a mantle.&rdquo; And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed down. "
19743,7936,1,1Kg,28015,"Now Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?&rdquo; And Saul answered, &ldquo;I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, neither by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may reveal to me what I should do.&rdquo; "
19744,7937,1,1Kg,28016,"Then Samuel said: &ldquo;Why then do you ask me, seeing the Lord has departed from you and has become your enemy? "
19745,7938,1,1Kg,28017,"And the Lord has done for Himself as He spoke by me. For the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David. "
19746,7939,1,1Kg,28018,"Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord nor execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day. "
19747,7940,1,1Kg,28019,"Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo; "
19748,7941,1,1Kg,28020,"Then immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night. "
19749,7942,1,1Kg,28021,"And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled, and said to him, &ldquo;Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me. "
19750,7943,1,1Kg,28022,"Now therefore, please, heed also the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.&rdquo; "
19751,7944,1,1Kg,28023,"But he refused and said, &ldquo;I will not eat.&rdquo; So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice. Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed. "
19752,7945,1,1Kg,28024,"Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it. "
19753,7946,1,1Kg,28025,"So she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night. "
19754,7947,1,1Kg,29001,"Then the Philistines gathered together all their armies at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel. "
19755,7948,1,1Kg,29002,"And the lords of the Philistines passed in review by hundreds and by thousands, but David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish. "
19756,7949,1,1Kg,29003,"Then the princes of the Philistines said, &ldquo;What are these Hebrews doing here?&rdquo; And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, &ldquo;Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years? And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected to me.&rdquo; "
19757,7950,1,1Kg,29004,"But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; so the princes of the Philistines said to him, &ldquo;Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he reconcile himself to his master, if not with the heads of these men? "
19758,7951,1,1Kg,29005,"Is this not David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying: &lsquo;Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands&rsquo;?&rdquo;"
19759,7952,1,1Kg,29006,"Then Achish called David and said to him, &ldquo;Surely, as the Lord lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless the lords do not favor you. "
19760,7953,1,1Kg,29007,"Therefore return now, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.&rdquo; "
19761,7954,1,1Kg,29008,"So David said to Achish, &ldquo;But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?&rdquo; "
19762,7955,1,1Kg,29009,"Then Achish answered and said to David, &ldquo;I know that you are as good in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, &lsquo;He shall not go up with us to the battle.&rsquo; "
19763,7956,1,1Kg,29010,"Now therefore, rise early in the morning with your master&rsquo;s servants who have come with you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.&rdquo; "
19764,7957,1,1Kg,29011,"So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. "
19765,7958,1,1Kg,30001,"Now it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire, "
19766,7959,1,1Kg,30002,"and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried them away and went their way. "
19767,7960,1,1Kg,30003,"So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. "
19768,7961,1,1Kg,30004,"Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep. "
19769,7962,1,1Kg,30005,"And David&rsquo;s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive. "
19770,7963,1,1Kg,30006,"Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God. "
19771,7964,1,1Kg,30007,"Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;Please bring the ephod here to me.&rdquo; And Abiathar brought the ephod to David. "
19772,7965,1,1Kg,30008,"So David inquired of the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?&rdquo; And He answered him, &ldquo;Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.&rdquo; "
19773,7966,1,1Kg,30009,"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind. "
19774,7967,1,1Kg,30010,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so weary that they could not cross the Brook Besor. "
19775,7968,1,1Kg,30011,"Then they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water. "
19776,7969,1,1Kg,30012,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. So when he had eaten, his strength came back to him; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights. "
19777,7970,1,1Kg,30013,"Then David said to him, &ldquo;To whom do you belong, and where are you from?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I am a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick. "
19778,7971,1,1Kg,30014,"We made an invasion of the southern area of the Cherethites, in the territory which belongs to Judah, and of the southern area of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.&rdquo; "
19779,7972,1,1Kg,30015,"And David said to him, &ldquo;Can you take me down to this troop?&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this troop.&rdquo; "
19780,7973,1,1Kg,30016,"And when he had brought him down, there they were, spread out over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. "
19781,7974,1,1Kg,30017,"Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled. "
19782,7975,1,1Kg,30018,"So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. "
19783,7976,1,1Kg,30019,"And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; David recovered all. "
19784,7977,1,1Kg,30020,"Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, &ldquo;This is David&rsquo;s spoil.&rdquo; "
19785,7978,1,1Kg,30021,"Now David came to the two hundred men who had been so weary that they could not follow David, whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor. So they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near the people, he greeted them. "
19786,7979,1,1Kg,30022,"Then all the wicked and worthless men of those who went with David answered and said, &ldquo;Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except for every man&rsquo;s wife and children, that they may lead them away and depart.&rdquo; "
19787,7980,1,1Kg,30023,"But David said, &ldquo;My brethren, you shall not do so with what the Lord has given us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us. "
19788,7981,1,1Kg,30024,"For who will heed you in this matter? But as his part is who goes down to the battle, so shall his part be who stays by the supplies; they shall share alike.&rdquo; "
19789,7982,1,1Kg,30025,"So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day. "
19790,7983,1,1Kg,30026,"Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, &ldquo;Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord&rdquo; &ndash; "
19791,7984,1,1Kg,30027,"to those who were in Bethel, those who were in Ramoth of the South, those who were in Jattir, "

19796,7989,1,1Kg,31001,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. "
19797,7990,1,1Kg,31002,"Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul&rsquo;s sons. "
19798,7991,1,1Kg,31003,"The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers. "
19799,7992,1,1Kg,31004,"Then Saul said to his armorbearer, &ldquo;Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me.&rdquo; But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. "
19800,7993,1,1Kg,31005,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him. "
19801,7994,1,1Kg,31006,"So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day. "
19802,7995,1,1Kg,31007,"And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. "
19803,7996,1,1Kg,31008,"So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. "
19804,7997,1,1Kg,31009,"And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people. "
19805,7998,1,1Kg,31010,"Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan."
19806,7999,1,1Kg,31011,"Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, "
19807,8000,1,1Kg,31012,"all the valiant men arose and traveled all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and burned them there. "
19808,8001,1,1Kg,31013,"Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. "
19809,8002,1,2Kg,1001,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag, "
19810,8003,1,2Kg,1002,"on the third day, behold, it happened that a man came from Saul&rsquo;s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself. "
19811,8004,1,2Kg,1003,"And David said to him, &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; So he said to him, &ldquo;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&rdquo; "
19812,8005,1,2Kg,1004,"Then David said to him, &ldquo;How did the matter go? Please tell me.&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.&rdquo; "
19813,8006,1,2Kg,1005,"So David said to the young man who told him, &ldquo;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?&rdquo; "
19814,8007,1,2Kg,1006,"Then the young man who told him said, &ldquo;As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. "
19815,8008,1,2Kg,1007,"Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo; "
19816,8009,1,2Kg,1008,"And he said to me, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; So I answered him, &lsquo;I am an Amalekite.&rsquo; "
19817,8010,1,2Kg,1009,"He said to me again, &lsquo;Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still remains in me.&rsquo; "
19818,8011,1,2Kg,1010,"So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.&rdquo; "
19819,8012,1,2Kg,1011,"Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. "
19820,8013,1,2Kg,1012,"And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. "
19821,8014,1,2Kg,1013,"Then David said to the young man who told him, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.&rdquo; "
19822,8015,1,2Kg,1014,"So David said to him, &ldquo;How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s anointed?&rdquo; "
19823,8016,1,2Kg,1015,"Then David called one of the young men and said, &ldquo;Go near, and execute him!&rdquo; And he struck him so that he died. "
19824,8017,1,2Kg,1016,"So David said to him, &ldquo;Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &lsquo;I have killed the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19825,8018,1,2Kg,1017,"Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, "

19836,8029,1,2Kg,2001,"It happened after this that David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said to him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go up? And He said, To Hebron. "
19837,8030,1,2Kg,2002,"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. "

19842,8035,1,2Kg,2007,"Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.&rdquo; "
19843,8036,1,2Kg,2008,"But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul&rsquo;s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim; "

19851,8044,1,2Kg,2016,"And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent&rsquo;s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which is in Gibeon. "
19852,8045,1,2Kg,2017,"So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David. "
19853,8046,1,2Kg,2018,Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was as fleet of foot as a wild gazelle.

19858,8051,1,2Kg,2023,"However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot.

19864,8057,1,2Kg,2029,"Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim. "
19865,8058,1,2Kg,2030,"So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David&rsquo;s servants nineteen men and Asahel. "
19866,8059,1,2Kg,2031,"But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner&rsquo;s men, three hundred and sixty men who died. "
19867,8060,1,2Kg,2032,"Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father&rsquo;s tomb, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak. "
19868,8061,1,2Kg,3001,"Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. "
19869,8062,1,2Kg,3002,"Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; "
19870,8063,1,2Kg,3003,"his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; "

19872,8065,1,2Kg,3005,"and the sixth, Ithream, by David&rsquo;s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron. "
19873,8066,1,2Kg,3006,"Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening his hold on the house of Saul. "
19874,8067,1,2Kg,3007,"And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ishbosheth said to Abner, &ldquo;Why have you gone in to my father&rsquo;s concubine?&rdquo; "
19875,8068,1,2Kg,3008,"Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, &ldquo;Am I a dog&rsquo;s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman? "
19876,8069,1,2Kg,3009,"May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as the Lord has sworn to him &ndash; "
19877,8070,1,2Kg,3010,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.&rdquo; "
19878,8071,1,2Kg,3011,"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him. "
19879,8072,1,2Kg,3012,"Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, &ldquo;Whose is the land?&rdquo; saying also, &ldquo;Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel to you.&rdquo; "
19880,8073,1,2Kg,3013,"And David said, &ldquo;Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, when you come to see my face.&rdquo; "
19881,8074,1,2Kg,3014,"So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul&rsquo;s son, saying, &ldquo;Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.&rdquo; "
19882,8075,1,2Kg,3015,"And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish. "
19883,8076,1,2Kg,3016,"Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, &ldquo;Go, return!&rdquo; And he returned. "
19884,8077,1,2Kg,3017,"Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, &ldquo;In time past you were seeking for David to be king over you. "
19885,8078,1,2Kg,3018,"Now then, do it! For the Lord has spoken of David, saying, &lsquo;By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19886,8079,1,2Kg,3019,And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin. 
19887,8080,1,2Kg,3020,So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. 
19888,8081,1,2Kg,3021,"Then Abner said to David, &ldquo;I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.&rdquo; So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace. "
19889,8082,1,2Kg,3022,"At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. "
19890,8083,1,2Kg,3023,"When Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, &ldquo;Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.&rdquo; "
19891,8084,1,2Kg,3024,"Then Joab came to the king and said, &ldquo;What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has already gone? "
19892,8085,1,2Kg,3025,"Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.&rdquo; "
19893,8086,1,2Kg,3026,"And when Joab had gone from David&rsquo;s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it. "
19894,8087,1,2Kg,3027,"Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother. "
19895,8088,1,2Kg,3028,"Afterward, when David heard it, he said, &ldquo;My kingdom and I are guiltless before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. "
19896,8089,1,2Kg,3029,"Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father&rsquo;s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.&rdquo; "
19897,8090,1,2Kg,3030,"So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. "
19898,8091,1,2Kg,3031,"Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, &ldquo;Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.&rdquo; And King David followed the coffin. "
19899,8092,1,2Kg,3032,"So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. "
19900,8093,1,2Kg,3033,"And the king sang a lament over Abner and said: &ldquo;Should Abner die as a fool dies? "
19901,8094,1,2Kg,3034,"Your hands were not bound Nor your feet put into fetters; As a man falls before wicked men, so you fell.&rdquo; Then all the people wept over him again. "
19902,8095,1,2Kg,3035,"And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, &ldquo;God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!&rdquo; "
19903,8096,1,2Kg,3036,"Now all the people took note of it, and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people. "
19904,8097,1,2Kg,3037,"For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king&rsquo;s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner. "
19905,8098,1,2Kg,3038,"Then the king said to his servants, &ldquo;Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? "
19906,8099,1,2Kg,3039,"And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. The Lord shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness.&rdquo; "
19907,8100,1,2Kg,4001,"When Saul&rsquo;s son* heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost heart, and all Israel was troubled. "
19908,8101,1,2Kg,4002,"Now Saul&rsquo;s son had two men who were captains of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin, "
19909,8102,1,2Kg,4003,because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day.) 
19910,8103,1,2Kg,4004,"Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth."
19911,8104,1,2Kg,4005,"Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon. "
19912,8105,1,2Kg,4006,"And they came there, all the way into the house, as though to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. "
19913,8106,1,2Kg,4007,"For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain. "
19914,8107,1,2Kg,4008,"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, &ldquo;Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants.&rdquo; "
19915,8108,1,2Kg,4009,"But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all adversity, "
19916,8109,1,2Kg,4010,"when someone told me, saying, &lsquo;Look, Saul is dead,&rsquo; thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag &ndash; the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news. "
19917,8110,1,2Kg,4011,"How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?&rdquo; "
19918,8111,1,2Kg,4012,"So David commanded his young men, and they executed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron. "
19919,8112,1,2Kg,5001,"Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, &ldquo;Indeed we are your bone and your flesh. "
19920,8113,1,2Kg,5002,"Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the Lord said to you, &lsquo;You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19921,8114,1,2Kg,5003,"Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel. "
19922,8115,1,2Kg,5004,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. "
19923,8116,1,2Kg,5005,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. "
19924,8117,1,2Kg,5006,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, &ldquo;You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you,&rdquo; thinking, &ldquo;David cannot come in here.&rdquo; "
19925,8118,1,2Kg,5007,"Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David). "
19926,8119,1,2Kg,5008,"Now David said on that day, &ldquo;Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, who are hated by David&rsquo;s soul), he shall be chief and captain.&rdquo; Therefore they say, &ldquo;The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.&rdquo; "
19927,8329,1,2Kg,13034,"Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked, and there, many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind him. "
19928,8330,1,2Kg,13035,"And Jonadab said to the king, &ldquo;Look, the king&rsquo;s sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.&rdquo; "
19929,8331,1,2Kg,13036,"So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that the king&rsquo;s sons indeed came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly. "
19930,8332,1,2Kg,13037,"But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. "
19931,8333,1,2Kg,13038,"So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years. "
19932,8334,1,2Kg,13039,"And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he was dead. "
19933,8335,1,2Kg,14001,"So Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king&rsquo;s heart was concerned about Absalom. "
19934,8336,1,2Kg,14002,"And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, &ldquo;Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel; do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning a long time for the dead. "
19935,8337,1,2Kg,14003,"Go to the king and speak to him in this manner.&rdquo; So Joab put the words in her mouth. "
19936,8338,1,2Kg,14004,"And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, &ldquo;Help, O king!&rdquo; "
19937,8339,1,2Kg,14005,"Then the king said to her, &ldquo;What troubles you?&rdquo; And she answered, &ldquo;Indeed I am a widow, my husband is dead. "
19938,8340,1,2Kg,14006,"Now your maidservant had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him. "
19939,8341,1,2Kg,14007,"And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant, and they said, &lsquo;Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him for the life of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also.&rsquo; So they would extinguish my ember that is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the earth.&rdquo; "
19940,8342,1,2Kg,14008,"Then the king said to the woman, &ldquo;Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.&rdquo; "
19941,8343,1,2Kg,14009,"And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, &ldquo;My lord, O king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father&rsquo;s house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.&rdquo; "
19942,8344,1,2Kg,14010,"So the king said, &ldquo;Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you anymore.&rdquo; "
19943,8345,1,2Kg,14011,"Then she said, &ldquo;Please let the king remember the Lord your God, and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.&rdquo; "
19944,8346,1,2Kg,14012,"Therefore the woman said, &ldquo;Please, let your maidservant speak another word to my lord the king.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Say on.&rdquo; "
19945,8347,1,2Kg,14013,"So the woman said: &ldquo;Why then have you schemed such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring his banished one home again. "
19946,8348,1,2Kg,14014,"For we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises means, so that His banished ones are not expelled from Him. "
19947,8349,1,2Kg,14015,"Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, &lsquo;I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant. "
19948,8350,1,2Kg,14016,"For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.&rsquo; "
19949,8351,1,2Kg,14017,"Your maidservant said, &lsquo;The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the Lord your God be with you.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19950,8352,1,2Kg,14018,"Then the king answered and said to the woman, &ldquo;Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you.&rdquo; And the woman said, &ldquo;Please, let my lord the king speak.&rdquo; "
19951,8353,1,2Kg,14019,"So the king said, &ldquo;Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?&rdquo; And the woman answered and said, &ldquo;As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant. "
19952,8354,1,2Kg,14020,"To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the earth.&rdquo; "
19953,8355,1,2Kg,14021,"And the king said to Joab, &ldquo;All right, I have granted this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.&rdquo; "
19954,8356,1,2Kg,14022,"Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and thanked the king. And Joab said, &ldquo;Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.&rdquo; "
19955,8357,1,2Kg,14023,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. "
19956,8358,1,2Kg,14024,"And the king said, &ldquo;Let him return to his own house, but do not let him see my face.&rdquo; So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the king&rsquo;s face. "
19957,8359,1,2Kg,14025,Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
19958,8360,1,2Kg,14026,"And when he cut the hair of his head &ndash; at the end of every year he cut it because it was heavy on him &ndash; when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king&rsquo;s standard. "
19959,8361,1,2Kg,14027,"To Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance. "
19960,8362,1,2Kg,14028,"And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, but did not see the king&rsquo;s face. "
19961,8363,1,2Kg,14029,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come. "
19962,8364,1,2Kg,14030,"So he said to his servants, &ldquo;See, Joab&rsquo;s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.&rdquo; And Absalom&rsquo;s servants set the field on fire. "
19963,8365,1,2Kg,14031,"Then Joab arose and came to Absalom&rsquo;s house, and said to him, &ldquo;Why have your servants set my field on fire?&rdquo; "
19964,8366,1,2Kg,14032,"And Absalom answered Joab, &ldquo;Look, I sent to you, saying, &lsquo;Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, &ldquo;Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.&rdquo; &lsquo; Now therefore, let me see the king&rsquo;s face; but if there is iniquity in me, let him execute me.&rdquo; "
19965,8367,1,2Kg,14033,"So Joab went to the king and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom. "
19966,8368,1,2Kg,15001,"After this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. "
19967,8369,1,2Kg,15002,"Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. So it was, whenever anyone who had a lawsuit came to the king for a decision, that Absalom would call to him and say, &ldquo;What city are you from?&rdquo; And he would say, &ldquo;Your servant is from such and such a tribe of Israel.&rdquo; "
19968,8370,1,2Kg,15003,"Then Absalom would say to him, &ldquo;Look, your case is good and right; but there is no deputy of the king to hear you.&rdquo; "
19969,8371,1,2Kg,15004,"Moreover Absalom would say, &ldquo;Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me; then I would give him justice.&rdquo; "
19970,8372,1,2Kg,15005,"And so it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he would put out his hand and take him and kiss him. "
19971,8373,1,2Kg,15006,In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
19972,8374,1,2Kg,15007,"Now it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said to the king, &ldquo;Please, let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the Lord. "
19973,8375,1,2Kg,15008,"For your servant took a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, &lsquo;If the Lord indeed brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19974,8376,1,2Kg,15009,"And the king said to him, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo; So he arose and went to Hebron. "
19975,8377,1,2Kg,15010,"Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &ldquo;As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, &lsquo;Absalom reigns in Hebron!&rsquo; &ldquo; "
19976,8378,1,2Kg,15011,"And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem, and they went along innocently and did not know anything. "
19977,8379,1,2Kg,15012,"Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&rsquo;s counselor, from his city &ndash; from Giloh &ndash; while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom continually increased in number. "
19978,8380,1,2Kg,15013,"Now a messenger came to David, saying, &ldquo;The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.&rdquo; "
19979,8381,1,2Kg,15014,"So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, &ldquo;Arise, and let us flee; or we shall not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.&rdquo; "
19980,8382,1,2Kg,15015,"And the king&rsquo;s servants said to the king, &ldquo;We are your servants, ready to do whatever my lord the king commands.&rdquo; "
19981,8383,1,2Kg,15016,"Then the king went out with all his household after him. But the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house. "
19982,8384,1,2Kg,15017,"And the king went out with all the people after him, and stopped at the outskirts. "
19983,8385,1,2Kg,15018,"Then all his servants passed before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, passed before the king. "
19984,8386,1,2Kg,15019,"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, &ldquo;Why are you also going with us? Return and remain with the king. For you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place. "
19985,8387,1,2Kg,15020,"In fact, you came only yesterday. Should I make you wander up and down with us today, since I go I know not where? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth be with you.&rdquo; "
19986,8388,1,2Kg,15021,"And Ittai answered the king and said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.&rdquo; "
19987,8389,1,2Kg,15022,"So David said to Ittai, &ldquo;Go, and cross over.&rdquo; Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over. "
19988,8390,1,2Kg,15023,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people crossed over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness. "
19989,8391,1,2Kg,15024,"There was Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city. "
19990,8392,1,2Kg,15025,"Then the king said to Zadok, &ldquo;Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place. "
19991,8393,1,2Kg,15026,"But if He says thus: &lsquo;I have no delight in you,&rsquo; here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.&rdquo; "
19992,8394,1,2Kg,15027,"The king also said to Zadok the priest, &ldquo;Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. "
19993,8395,1,2Kg,15028,"See, I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.&rdquo; "
19994,8396,1,2Kg,15029,Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there. 
19995,8397,1,2Kg,15030,"So David went up by the Ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered and went barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went up. "
19996,8398,1,2Kg,15031,"Then someone told David, saying, &ldquo;Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.&rdquo; And David said, &ldquo;O Lord, I pray, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!&rdquo; "
19997,8399,1,2Kg,15032,"Now it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain, where he worshiped God &ndash; there was Hushai the Archite coming to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head. "
19998,8400,1,2Kg,15033,"David said to him, &ldquo;If you go on with me, then you will become a burden to me. "
19999,8401,1,2Kg,15034,"But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, &lsquo;I will be your servant, O king; as I was your father&rsquo;s servant previously, so I will now also be your servant,&rsquo; then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me. "
20000,8402,1,2Kg,15035,"And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the king&rsquo;s house, you shall tell to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. "
20001,8403,1,2Kg,15036,"Indeed they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok&rsquo;s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar&rsquo;s son; and by them you shall send me everything you hear.&rdquo; "
20002,8404,1,2Kg,15037,"So Hushai, David&rsquo;s friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem. "
20003,8405,1,2Kg,16001,"When David was a little past the top of the mountain, there was Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth, who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine. "
20004,8406,1,2Kg,16002,"And the king said to Ziba, &ldquo;What do you mean to do with these?&rdquo; So Ziba said, &ldquo;The donkeys are for the king&rsquo;s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.&rdquo; "
20005,8407,1,2Kg,16003,"Then the king said, &ldquo;And where is your master&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; And Ziba said to the king, &ldquo;Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, &lsquo;Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20006,8408,1,2Kg,16004,"So the king said to Ziba, &ldquo;Here, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.&rdquo; And Ziba said, &ldquo;I humbly bow before you, that I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O king!&rdquo; "
20007,8409,1,2Kg,16005,"Now when King David came to Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came. "
20008,8410,1,2Kg,16006,And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 
20009,8411,1,2Kg,16007,"Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: &ldquo;Come out! Come out! You bloodthirsty man, you rogue! "
20010,8412,1,2Kg,16008,"The Lord has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you are caught in your own evil, because you are a bloodthirsty man!&rdquo; "
20011,8413,1,2Kg,16009,"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, &ldquo;Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!&rdquo; "
20012,8414,1,2Kg,16010,"But the king said, &ldquo;What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the Lord has said to him, &lsquo;Curse David.&rsquo; Who then shall say, &lsquo;Why have you done so?&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20013,8415,1,2Kg,16011,"And David said to Abishai and all his servants, &ldquo;See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life. How much more now may this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for so the Lord has ordered him. "
20014,8416,1,2Kg,16012,"It may be that the Lord will look on my affliction, and that the Lord will repay me with good for his cursing this day.&rdquo; "
20015,8417,1,2Kg,16013,"And as David and his men went along the road, Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him and kicked up dust. "
20016,8418,1,2Kg,16014,"Now the king and all the people who were with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there. "
20017,8419,1,2Kg,16015,"Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel was with him. "
20018,8420,1,2Kg,16016,"And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, David&rsquo;s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, &ldquo;Long live the king! Long live the king!&rdquo; "
20019,8421,1,2Kg,16017,"So Absalom said to Hushai, &ldquo;Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?&rdquo; "
20020,8422,1,2Kg,16018,"And Hushai said to Absalom, &ldquo;No, but whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his I will be, and with him I will remain. "
20021,8423,1,2Kg,16019,"Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father&rsquo;s presence, so will I be in your presence.&rdquo; "
20022,8424,1,2Kg,16020,"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, &ldquo;Give counsel as to what we should do.&rdquo; "
20023,8425,1,2Kg,16021,"And Ahithophel said to Absalom, &ldquo;Go in to your father&rsquo;s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.&rdquo; "
20024,8426,1,2Kg,16022,"So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father&rsquo;s concubines in the sight of all Israel. "
20025,8427,1,2Kg,16023,"Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one had inquired at the oracle of God. So was all the advice of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. "
20026,8428,1,2Kg,17001,"Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, &ldquo;Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. "
20027,8429,1,2Kg,17002,"I will come upon him while he is weary and weak, and make him afraid. And all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike only the king. "
20028,8430,1,2Kg,17003,"Then I will bring back all the people to you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people will be at peace.&rdquo; "
20029,8431,1,2Kg,17004,And the saying pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel. 
20030,8432,1,2Kg,17005,"Then Absalom said, &ldquo;Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he says too.&rdquo; "
20031,8433,1,2Kg,17006,"And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.&rdquo; "
20032,8434,1,2Kg,17007,"So Hushai said to Absalom: &ldquo;The advice that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time. "
20033,8435,1,2Kg,17008,"For,&rdquo; said Hushai, &ldquo;you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are enraged in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not camp with the people. "
20034,8436,1,2Kg,17009,"Surely by now he is hidden in some pit, or in some other place. And it will be, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whoever hears it will say, &lsquo;There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.&rsquo; "
20035,8437,1,2Kg,17010,"And even he who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt completely. For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men. "
20036,8438,1,2Kg,17011,"Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, like the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. "
20037,8439,1,2Kg,17012,"So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one. "
20038,8440,1,2Kg,17013,"Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we will pull it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.&rdquo; "
20039,8441,1,2Kg,17014,"So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, &ldquo;The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.&rdquo; For the Lord had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring disaster on Absalom. "
20040,8442,1,2Kg,17015,"Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, &ldquo;Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised. "
20041,8443,1,2Kg,17016,"Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, &lsquo;Do not spend this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily cross over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20042,8444,1,2Kg,17017,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a female servant would come and tell them, and they would go and tell King David. "
20043,8445,1,2Kg,17018,"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man&rsquo;s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it. "
20044,8446,1,2Kg,17019,"Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well&rsquo;s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known. "
20045,8447,1,2Kg,17020,"And when Absalom&rsquo;s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, &ldquo;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&rdquo; So the woman said to them, &ldquo;They have gone over the water brook.&rdquo; And when they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. "
20046,8448,1,2Kg,17021,"Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said to David, &ldquo;Arise and cross over the water quickly. For thus has Ahithophel advised against you.&rdquo; "
20047,8449,1,2Kg,17022,So David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not gone over the Jordan. 
20048,8450,1,2Kg,17023,"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father&rsquo;s tomb. "
20049,8451,1,2Kg,17024,"Then David went to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. "
20050,8452,1,2Kg,17025,"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab&rsquo;s mother. "
20051,8453,1,2Kg,17026,So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead. 
20052,8454,1,2Kg,17027,"Now it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, "
20053,8455,1,2Kg,17028,"brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, parched grain and beans, lentils and parched seeds, "
20054,8456,1,2Kg,17029,"honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him to eat. For they said, &ldquo;The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.&rdquo; "
20055,8457,1,2Kg,18001,"And David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. "
20056,8458,1,2Kg,18002,"Then David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab&rsquo;s brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, &ldquo;I also will surely go out with you myself.&rdquo; "
20057,8459,1,2Kg,18003,"But the people answered, &ldquo;You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us now. For you are now more help to us in the city.&rdquo; "
20058,8460,1,2Kg,18004,"Then the king said to them, &ldquo;Whatever seems best to you I will do.&rdquo; So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. "
20059,8461,1,2Kg,18005,"Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, &ldquo;Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.&rdquo; And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom. "
20060,8462,1,2Kg,18006,So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel. And the battle was in the woods of Ephraim. 
20061,8463,1,2Kg,18007,"The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David, and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day. "
20062,8464,1,2Kg,18008,"For the battle there was scattered over the face of the whole countryside, and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. "
20063,8465,1,2Kg,18009,"Then Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule. The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between heaven and earth. And the mule which was under him went on. "
20064,8466,1,2Kg,18010,"Now a certain man saw it and told Joab, and said, &ldquo;I just saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree!&rdquo; "
20065,8467,1,2Kg,18011,"So Joab said to the man who told him, &ldquo;You just saw him! And why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt.&rdquo; "
20066,8468,1,2Kg,18012,"But the man said to Joab, &ldquo;Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king&rsquo;s son. For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, &lsquo;Beware lest anyone touch the young man Absalom!&rsquo;"
20067,8469,1,2Kg,18013,"Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.&rdquo; "
20068,8470,1,2Kg,18014,"Then Joab said, &ldquo;I cannot linger with you.&rdquo; And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom&rsquo;s heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree. "
20069,8471,1,2Kg,18015,"And ten young men who bore Joab&rsquo;s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him. "
20070,8472,1,2Kg,18016,"So Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab held back the people. "
20071,8473,1,2Kg,18017,"And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods, and laid a very large heap of stones over him. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his tent. "
20072,8474,1,2Kg,18018,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which is in the King&rsquo;s Valley. For he said, &ldquo;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.&rdquo; He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absalom&rsquo;s Monument. "
20073,8475,1,2Kg,18019,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, &ldquo;Let me run now and take the news to the king, how the Lord has avenged him of his enemies.&rdquo; "
20074,8476,1,2Kg,18020,"And Joab said to him, &ldquo;You shall not take the news this day, for you shall take the news another day. But today you shall take no news, because the king&rsquo;s son is dead.&rdquo; "
20075,8477,1,2Kg,18021,"Then Joab said to the Cushite, &ldquo;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&rdquo; So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran. "
20076,8478,1,2Kg,18022,"And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, &ldquo;But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.&rdquo; So Joab said, &ldquo;Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?&rdquo; "
20077,8479,1,2Kg,18023,"But whatever happens, he said, let me run. So he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran the Cushite. "
20078,8480,1,2Kg,18024,"Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to the wall, lifted his eyes and looked, and there was a man, running alone. "
20079,8481,1,2Kg,18025,"Then the watchman cried out and told the king. And the king said, &ldquo;If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.&rdquo; And he came rapidly and drew near. "
20080,8482,1,2Kg,18026,"Then the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, &ldquo;There is another man, running alone!&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;He also brings news.&rdquo; "
20081,8483,1,2Kg,18027,"So the watchman said, &ldquo;I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;He is a good man, and comes with good news.&rdquo; "
20082,8484,1,2Kg,18028,"And Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, &ldquo;All is well!&rdquo; Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king, and said, &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king!&rdquo; "
20083,8485,1,2Kg,18029,"The king said, &ldquo;Is the young man Absalom safe?&rdquo; Ahimaaz answered, &ldquo;When Joab sent the king&rsquo;s servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was about.&rdquo; "
20084,8486,1,2Kg,18030,"And the king said, &ldquo;Turn aside and stand here.&rdquo; So he turned aside and stood still. "
20085,8487,1,2Kg,18031,"Just then the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, &ldquo;There is good news, my lord the king! For the Lord has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you.&rdquo; "
20086,8488,1,2Kg,18032,"And the king said to the Cushite, &ldquo;Is the young man Absalom safe?&rdquo; So the Cushite answered, &ldquo;May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against you to do harm, be like that young man!&rdquo; "
20087,8489,1,2Kg,18033,"Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: &ldquo;O my son Absalom &ndash; my son, my son Absalom &ndash; if only I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!&rdquo; "
20088,8490,1,2Kg,19001,"And Joab was told, &ldquo;Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.&rdquo; "
20089,8491,1,2Kg,19002,"So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said that day, &ldquo;The king is grieved for his son.&rdquo; "
20090,8492,1,2Kg,19003,"And the people stole back into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. "
20091,8493,1,2Kg,19004,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!&rdquo; "
20092,8494,1,2Kg,19005,"Then Joab came into the house to the king, and said, &ldquo;Today you have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines, "
20093,8495,1,2Kg,19006,"in that you love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, then it would have pleased you well. "
20094,8496,1,2Kg,19007,"Now therefore, arise, go out and speak comfort to your servants. For I swear by the Lord, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.&rdquo; "
20095,8497,1,2Kg,19008,"Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And they told all the people, saying, &ldquo;There is the king, sitting in the gate.&rdquo; So all the people came before the king. For everyone of Israel had fled to his tent. "
20096,8498,1,2Kg,19009,"Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &ldquo;The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom. "
20097,8499,1,2Kg,19010,"But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing back the king?&rdquo; "
20098,8500,1,2Kg,19011,"So King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, &ldquo;Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, &lsquo;Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the words of all Israel have come to the king, to his very house? "
20099,8501,1,2Kg,19012,"You are my brethren, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?&rsquo; "
20100,8502,1,2Kg,19013,"And say to Amasa, &lsquo;Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20101,8503,1,2Kg,19014,"So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah, just as the heart of one man, so that they sent this word to the king: &ldquo;Return, you and all your servants!&rdquo; "
20102,8504,1,2Kg,19015,"Then the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to escort the king across the Jordan. "

20106,8508,1,2Kg,19019,"Then he said to the king, &ldquo;Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember what wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king left Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart. "
20107,8509,1,2Kg,19020,"For I, your servant, know that I have sinned. Therefore here I am, the first to come today of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.&rdquo; "
20108,8510,1,2Kg,19021,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, &ldquo;Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord&rsquo;s anointed?&rdquo; "

20113,8515,1,2Kg,19026,"And he answered, &ldquo;My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, &lsquo;I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go to the king,&rsquo; because your servant is lame. "
20114,8516,1,2Kg,19027,"And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is like the angel of God. Therefore do what is good in your eyes. "
20115,8517,1,2Kg,19028,"For all my father&rsquo;s house were but dead men before my lord the king. Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table. Therefore what right have I still to cry out anymore to the king?&rdquo; "

20123,8525,1,2Kg,19036,Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king. And why should the king repay me with such a reward? 
20124,8526,1,2Kg,19037,"Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.&rdquo; "
20125,8527,1,2Kg,19038,"And the king answered, &ldquo;Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you. Now whatever you request of me, I will do for you.&rdquo; "
20126,8528,1,2Kg,19039,"Then all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place. "
20127,8529,1,2Kg,19040,"Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. And all the people of Judah escorted the king, and also half the people of Israel. "
20128,8530,1,2Kg,19041,"Just then all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, &ldquo;Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, his household, and all David&rsquo;s men with him across the Jordan?&rdquo; "
20129,8531,1,2Kg,19042,"So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, &ldquo;Because the king is a close relative of ours. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we ever eaten at the king&rsquo;s expense? Or has he given us any gift?&rdquo; "
20130,8532,1,2Kg,19043,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, &ldquo;We have ten shares in the king; therefore we also have more right to David than you. Why then do you despise us &ndash; were we not the first to advise bringing back our king?&rdquo; Yet the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. "
20131,8533,1,2Kg,20001,"And there happened to be there a rebel,* whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a trumpet, and said: &ldquo;We have no share in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!&rdquo; "
20132,8534,1,2Kg,20002,"So every man of Israel deserted David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, remained loyal to their king. "
20133,8535,1,2Kg,20003,"Now David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in seclusion and supported them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood. "
20134,8536,1,2Kg,20004,"And the king said to Amasa, &ldquo;Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.&rdquo; "

20141,8543,1,2Kg,20011,"Meanwhile one of Joab&rsquo;s men stood near Amasa, and said, &ldquo;Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David &ndash; follow Joab!&rdquo; "

20143,8545,1,2Kg,20013,"When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. "
20144,8546,1,2Kg,20014,And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after Sheba.
20145,8547,1,2Kg,20015,"Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down. "
20146,8548,1,2Kg,20016,"Then a wise woman cried out from the city, &ldquo;Hear, Hear! Please say to Joab, &lsquo;Come nearby, that I may speak with you.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20147,8549,1,2Kg,20017,"When he had come near to her, the woman said, &ldquo;Are you Joab?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Then she said to him, &ldquo;Hear the words of your maidservant.&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo; "
20148,8550,1,2Kg,20018,"So she spoke, saying, &ldquo;They used to talk in former times, saying, &lsquo;They shall surely seek guidance at Abel,&rsquo; and so they would end disputes. "
20149,8551,1,2Kg,20019,"I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the Lord?&rdquo; "
20150,8552,1,2Kg,20020,"And Joab answered and said, &ldquo;Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy! "
20151,8553,1,2Kg,20021,"That is not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against the king, against David.

20152,8554,1,2Kg,20022,"Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew a trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem. "
20153,8555,1,2Kg,20023,"And Joab was over all the army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; "

20158,8560,1,2Kg,21002,"So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; the children of Israel had sworn protection to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.

20351,8911,1,3Kg,7017,"He made a lattice network, with wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which were on top of the pillars: seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital. "
20352,8912,1,3Kg,7018,"So he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that were on top; and thus he did for the other capital. "
20353,8913,1,3Kg,7019,"The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were in the shape of lilies, four cubits. "

20356,8916,1,3Kg,7022,The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies. So the work of the pillars was finished. 
20357,8917,1,3Kg,7023,"And he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. "

20572,9282,1,3Kg,18013,"Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hid one hundred men of the Lord&rsquo;s prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? "

20574,9284,1,3Kg,18015,"Then Elijah said, &ldquo;As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.&rdquo; "
20575,9285,1,3Kg,18016,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. "
20576,9286,1,3Kg,18017,"Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, &ldquo;Is that you, O troubler of Israel?&rdquo; "
20577,9287,1,3Kg,18018,"And he answered, &ldquo;I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father&rsquo;s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals. "
20578,9288,1,3Kg,18019,"Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; "
20579,9289,1,3Kg,18020,"So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel. "
20580,9290,1,3Kg,18021,"And Elijah came to all the people, and said, &ldquo;How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.&rdquo; But the people answered him not a word. "
20581,9291,1,3Kg,18022,"Then Elijah said to the people, &ldquo;I alone am left a prophet of the Lord; but Baal&rsquo;s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. "
20582,9292,1,3Kg,18023,"Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it. "
20583,9293,1,3Kg,18024,"Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.&rdquo; So all the people answered and said, &ldquo;It is well spoken.&rdquo; "
20584,9294,1,3Kg,18025,"Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, &ldquo;Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.&rdquo; "
20585,9295,1,3Kg,18026,"So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, &ldquo;O Baal, hear us!&rdquo; But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made. "
20586,9296,1,3Kg,18027,"And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, &ldquo;Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.&rdquo; "
20587,9297,1,3Kg,18028,"So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. "
20588,9298,1,3Kg,18029,"And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention. "
20589,9299,1,3Kg,18030,"Then Elijah said to all the people, &ldquo;Come near to me.&rdquo; So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. "
20590,9300,1,3Kg,18031,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, &ldquo;Israel shall be your name.&rdquo;"
20591,9301,1,3Kg,18032,"Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. "
20592,9302,1,3Kg,18033,"And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, &ldquo;Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.&rdquo; "
20593,9303,1,3Kg,18034,"Then he said, &ldquo;Do it a second time,&rdquo; and they did it a second time; and he said, &ldquo;Do it a third time,&rdquo; and they did it a third time. "
20594,9304,1,3Kg,18035,"So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water. "
20595,9305,1,3Kg,18036,"And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, &ldquo;Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.

20597,9307,1,3Kg,18038,"Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench. "
20598,9308,1,3Kg,18039,"Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, &ldquo;The Lord, He is God! The Lord, He is God!&rdquo; "
20599,9309,1,3Kg,18040,"And Elijah said to them, &ldquo;Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!&rdquo; So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there. "
20600,9310,1,3Kg,18041,"Then Elijah said to Ahab, &ldquo;Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.&rdquo; "
20601,9311,1,3Kg,18042,"So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, "

20603,9313,1,3Kg,18044,"Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, &ldquo;There is a cloud, as small as a man&rsquo;s hand, rising out of the sea!&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Go up, say to Ahab, &lsquo;Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20604,9314,1,3Kg,18045,"Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. "
20605,9315,1,3Kg,18046,"Then the hand of the Lord came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. "

20607,9317,1,3Kg,19002,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &ldquo;So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.&rdquo; "
20608,9318,1,3Kg,19003,"And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. "

20610,9320,1,3Kg,19005,"Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, &ldquo;Arise and eat.&rdquo; "

20621,9331,1,3Kg,19016,Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place. 
20622,9332,1,3Kg,19017,"It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill. "
20623,9333,1,3Kg,19018,"Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.&rdquo; "
20624,9334,1,3Kg,19019,"So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him. "
20625,9335,1,3Kg,19020,"And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, &ldquo;Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Go back again, for what have I done to you?&rdquo; "
20626,9336,1,3Kg,19021,"So Elisha turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen&rsquo;s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, and became his servant. "
20627,9337,1,3Kg,20001,"Now Ben-Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together; thirty-two kings were with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and made war against it. "
20628,9338,1,3Kg,20002,"Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Ben-Hadad: "

20631,9341,1,3Kg,20005,"Then the messengers came back and said, &ldquo;Thus speaks Ben-Hadad, saying, &lsquo;Indeed I have sent to you, saying, &ldquo;You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children&rdquo;; "
20632,9342,1,3Kg,20006,"but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their hands and take it.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20633,9343,1,3Kg,20007,"So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, &ldquo;Notice, please, and see how this man seeks trouble, for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I did not deny him.&rdquo; "
20634,9344,1,3Kg,20008,"And all the elders and all the people said to him, &ldquo;Do not listen or consent.&rdquo; "

20636,9346,1,3Kg,20010,"Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, &ldquo;The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.&rdquo; "
20637,9347,1,3Kg,20011,"So the king of Israel answered and said, &ldquo;Tell him, &lsquo;Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20638,9348,1,3Kg,20012,"And it happened when Ben-Hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking at the command post, that he said to his servants, &ldquo;Get ready.&rdquo; And they got ready to attack the city. "
20639,9349,1,3Kg,20013,"Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the Lord.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20640,9350,1,3Kg,20014,"So Ahab said, &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;By the young leaders of the provinces.&rsquo; &ldquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Who will set the battle in order?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;You.&rdquo; "
20641,9351,1,3Kg,20015,"Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people, all the children of Israel &ndash; seven thousand. "
20642,9352,1,3Kg,20016,So they went out at noon. Meanwhile Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were getting drunk at the command post. 
20643,9353,1,3Kg,20017,"The young leaders of the provinces went out first. And Ben-Hadad sent out a patrol, and they told him, saying, &ldquo;Men are coming out of Samaria!&rdquo; "
20644,9354,1,3Kg,20018,"So he said, &ldquo;If they have come out for peace, take them alive; and if they have come out for war, take them alive.&rdquo; "
20645,9355,1,3Kg,20019,Then these young leaders of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them. 
20646,9356,1,3Kg,20020,"And each one killed his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry. "
20647,9357,1,3Kg,20021,"Then the king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter. "
20648,9358,1,3Kg,20022,"And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, &ldquo;Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, for in the spring of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.&rdquo; "
20649,9359,1,3Kg,20023,"Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him, &ldquo;Their gods are gods of the hills. Therefore they were stronger than we; but if we fight against them in the plain, surely we will be stronger than they. "
20650,9360,1,3Kg,20024,"So do this thing: Dismiss the kings, each from his position, and put captains in their places; "
20651,9361,1,3Kg,20025,"and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they.&rdquo; And he listened to their voice and did so. "
20652,9362,1,3Kg,20026,"So it was, in the spring of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. "
20653,9363,1,3Kg,20027,"And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the countryside. "
20654,9364,1,3Kg,20028,"Then a man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Because the Syrians have said, &ldquo;The Lord is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys,&rdquo; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20655,9365,1,3Kg,20029,"And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day. "
20656,9366,1,3Kg,20030,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; then a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. And Ben-Hadad fled and went into the city, into an inner chamber. "
20657,9367,1,3Kg,20031,"Then his servants said to him, &ldquo;Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please, let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.&rdquo; "
20658,9368,1,3Kg,20032,"So they wore sackcloth around their waists and put ropes around their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, &ldquo;Your servant Ben-Hadad says, &lsquo;Please let me live.&rsquo; &ldquo; And he said, &ldquo;Is he still alive? He is my brother.&rdquo; "
20659,9369,1,3Kg,20033,"Now the men were watching closely to see whether any sign of mercy would come from him; and they quickly grasped at this word and said, &ldquo;Your brother Ben-Hadad.&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Go, bring him.&rdquo; Then Ben-Hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot. "
20660,9370,1,3Kg,20034,"So Ben-Hadad said to him, &ldquo;The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.&rdquo; Then Ahab said, &ldquo;I will send you away with this treaty.&rdquo; So he made a treaty with him and sent him away. "
20661,9371,1,3Kg,20035,"Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the Lord, &ldquo;Strike me, please.&rdquo; And the man refused to strike him. "
20662,9372,1,3Kg,20036,"Then he said to him, &ldquo;Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, surely, as soon as you depart from me, a lion shall kill you.&rdquo; And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and killed him. "
20663,9373,1,3Kg,20037,"And he found another man, and said, &ldquo;Strike me, please.&rdquo; So the man struck him, inflicting a wound. "
20664,9374,1,3Kg,20038,"Then the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. "
20665,9375,1,3Kg,20039,"Now as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, &ldquo;Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and there, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, &lsquo;Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.&rsquo; "
20666,9376,1,3Kg,20040,"While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.&rdquo; Then the king of Israel said to him, &ldquo;So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.&rdquo; "
20667,9377,1,3Kg,20041,"And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. "
20668,9378,1,3Kg,20042,"Then he said to him, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Because you have let slip out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20669,9379,1,3Kg,20043,"So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria. "
20670,9380,1,3Kg,21001,"And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. "
20671,9381,1,3Kg,21002,"So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, &ldquo;Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.&rdquo; "
20672,9382,1,3Kg,21003,"But Naboth said to Ahab, &ldquo;The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!&rdquo; "
20673,9383,1,3Kg,21004,"So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, &ldquo;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&rdquo; And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food. "
20674,9384,1,3Kg,21005,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, &ldquo;Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?&rdquo; "
20675,9385,1,3Kg,21006,"He said to her, &ldquo;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, &lsquo;Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.&rsquo; And he answered, &lsquo;I will not give you my vineyard.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20676,9386,1,3Kg,21007,"Then Jezebel his wife said to him, &ldquo;You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&rdquo; "
20677,9387,1,3Kg,21008,"And she wrote letters in Ahab&rsquo;s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth. "
20678,9388,1,3Kg,21009,"She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with high honor among the people; "
20679,9389,1,3Kg,21010,"and seat two men, scoundrels, before him to bear witness against him, saying, &ldquo;You have blasphemed God and the king.&rdquo; Then take him out, and stone him, that he may die. "
20680,9390,1,3Kg,21011,"So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them. "
20681,9391,1,3Kg,21012,"They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth with high honor among the people. "
20682,9392,1,3Kg,21013,"And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &ldquo;Naboth has blasphemed God and the king!&rdquo; Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died. "
20683,9393,1,3Kg,21014,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &ldquo;Naboth has been stoned and is dead.&rdquo; "
20684,9394,1,3Kg,21015,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, &ldquo;Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&rdquo; "
20685,9395,1,3Kg,21016,"So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. "
20686,9396,1,3Kg,21017,"Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, "
20687,9466,1,4Kg,2021,"Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20688,9467,1,4Kg,2022,"So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. "
20689,9604,1,4Kg,7003,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, &ldquo;Why are we sitting here until we die? "
20690,9605,1,4Kg,7004,"If we say, &lsquo;We will enter the city,&rsquo; the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also.

20691,9606,1,4Kg,7005,"And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there. "
20692,9607,1,4Kg,7006,"For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses &ndash; the noise of a great army; so they said to one another, &ldquo;Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!&rdquo; "
20693,9608,1,4Kg,7007,"Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact &ndash; their tents, their horses, and their donkeys &ndash; and they fled for their lives. "
20694,9609,1,4Kg,7008,"And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back and entered another tent, and carried some from there also, and went and hid it. "
20695,9610,1,4Kg,7009,"Then they said to one another, &ldquo;We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king&rsquo;s household.&rdquo; "
20696,9611,1,4Kg,7010,"So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, &ldquo;We went to the Syrian camp, and surprisingly no one was there, not a human sound &ndash; only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents intact.&rdquo; "
20697,9612,1,4Kg,7011,"And the gatekeepers called out, and they told it to the king&rsquo;s household inside. "
20698,9613,1,4Kg,7012,"So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, &ldquo;Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, &lsquo;When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
20699,9614,1,4Kg,7013,"And one of his servants answered and said, &ldquo;Please, let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city.

20700,9615,1,4Kg,7014,"Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army, saying, &ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo; "
20701,9616,1,4Kg,7015,"And they went after them to the Jordan; and indeed all the road was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and told the king. "
20702,9617,1,4Kg,7016,"Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord. "
20703,9618,1,4Kg,7017,"Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. "
20704,9619,1,4Kg,7018,"So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, &ldquo;Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be sold tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.&rdquo; "

20706,9621,1,4Kg,7020,"And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died. "
20707,9622,1,4Kg,8001,"Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, &ldquo;Arise and go, you and your household, and stay wherever you can; for the Lord has called for a famine, and furthermore, it will come upon the land for seven years.&rdquo; "
20708,9623,1,4Kg,8002,"So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years. "
20709,9624,1,4Kg,8003,"It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land. "
20710,9625,1,4Kg,8004,"Then the king talked with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, &ldquo;Tell me, please, all the great things Elisha has done.&rdquo; "
20711,9626,1,4Kg,8005,"Now it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that there was the woman whose son he had restored to life, appealing to the king for her house and for her land.

20712,9627,1,4Kg,8006,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed a certain officer for her, saying, &ldquo;Restore all that was hers, and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the land until now.&rdquo; "
20713,9628,1,4Kg,8007,"Then Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, &ldquo;The man of God has come here.&rdquo; "

20718,9633,1,4Kg,8012,"And Hazael said, &ldquo;Why is my lord weeping?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.&rdquo; "
20719,9634,1,4Kg,8013,"So Hazael said, &ldquo;But what is your servant &ndash; a dog, that he should do this gross thing?&rdquo; And Elisha answered, &ldquo;The Lord has shown me that you will become king over Syria.&rdquo; "
20720,9635,1,4Kg,8014,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, &ldquo;What did Elisha say to you?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;He told me you would surely recover.&rdquo; "

21727,11326,1,2Chr,15005,"And in those times there was no peace to the one who went out, nor to the one who came in, but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands. "

21730,11329,1,2Chr,15008,"And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of the Lord that was before the vestibule of the Lord.

21731,11330,1,2Chr,15009,"Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who dwelt with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him. "
21732,11331,1,2Chr,15010,"So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. "

21736,11335,1,2Chr,15014,"Then they took an oath before the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and rams&rsquo; horns. "
21737,11336,1,2Chr,15015,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the Lord gave them rest all around. "
21738,11337,1,2Chr,15016,"Also he removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah; and Asa cut down her obscene image, then crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron. "
21739,11338,1,2Chr,15017,But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days. 
21740,11339,1,2Chr,15018,He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.

21742,11341,1,2Chr,16001,"In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. "
21743,11342,1,2Chr,16002,"Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king&rsquo;s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying, "
21744,11343,1,2Chr,16003,"Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Here, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me. "
21745,11344,1,2Chr,16004,"So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. "
21746,11345,1,2Chr,16005,"Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work. "
21747,11346,1,2Chr,16006,"Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah. "
21748,11347,1,2Chr,16007,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: &ldquo;Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand. "

21751,11350,1,2Chr,16010,"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time. "
21752,11351,1,2Chr,16011,"Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. "
21753,11352,1,2Chr,16012,"And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but the physicians. "
21754,11353,1,2Chr,16013,"So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign. "
21755,11354,1,2Chr,16014,"They buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments. They made a very great burning for him. "

21760,11359,1,2Chr,17005,"Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance. "

21762,11361,1,2Chr,17007,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. "
21763,11362,1,2Chr,17008,"And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah &ndash; the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. "
21764,11363,1,2Chr,17009,"So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of the Lord with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people. "

21767,11366,1,2Chr,17012,"So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. "

21849,11524,1,2Chr,24016,"And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house. "
21850,11525,1,2Chr,24017,Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king listened to them. 
21851,11526,1,2Chr,24018,"Therefore they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served wooden images and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass. "
21852,11527,1,2Chr,24019,"Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the Lord; and they testified against them, but they would not listen. "
21853,11528,1,2Chr,24020,"Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, &ldquo;Thus says God: &lsquo;Why do you transgress the commandments of the Lord, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the Lord, He also has forsaken you.&rsquo; &ldquo; "
21854,11529,1,2Chr,24021,"So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord. "
21855,11530,1,2Chr,24022,"Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, &ldquo;The Lord look on it, and repay!&rdquo; "
21856,11531,1,2Chr,24023,"So it happened in the spring of the year that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. "
21857,11532,1,2Chr,24024,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but the Lord delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. "
21858,11533,1,2Chr,24025,"And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings. "
21859,11534,1,2Chr,24026,"These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. "
21860,11535,1,2Chr,24027,"Now concerning his sons, and the many oracles about him, and the repairing of the house of God, indeed they are written in the annals of the book of the kings. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place. "
21861,11536,1,2Chr,25001,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. "
21862,11537,1,2Chr,25002,"And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a loyal heart. "
21863,11538,1,2Chr,25003,"Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king. "
21864,11539,1,2Chr,25004,"However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, &ldquo;The fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall die for his own sin.&rdquo; "
21865,11540,1,2Chr,25005,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, who could handle spear and shield. "
21866,11541,1,2Chr,25006,He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. 
21867,11542,1,2Chr,25007,"But a man of God came to him, saying, &ldquo;O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel &ndash; not with any of the children of Ephraim. "
21868,11543,1,2Chr,25008,"But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! Even so, God shall make you fall before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.&rdquo; "
21869,11544,1,2Chr,25009,"Then Amaziah said to the man of God, &ldquo;But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?&rdquo; And the man of God answered, &ldquo;The Lord is able to give you much more than this.&rdquo; "
21870,11545,1,2Chr,25010,"So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and they returned home in great anger. "
21871,11546,1,2Chr,25011,"Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir. "
21872,11547,1,2Chr,25012,"Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were dashed in pieces. "
21873,11548,1,2Chr,25013,"But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much spoil. "
21874,11549,1,2Chr,25014,"Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them. "
21875,11550,1,2Chr,25015,"Therefore the anger of the Lord was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, &ldquo;Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?&rdquo; "
21876,11551,1,2Chr,25016,"So it was, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, &ldquo;Have we made you the king&rsquo;s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?&rdquo; Then the prophet ceased, and said, &ldquo;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.&rdquo; "
21877,11552,1,2Chr,25017,"Now Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Come, let us face one another in battle.&rdquo; "
21878,11553,1,2Chr,25018,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, &ldquo;The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, &lsquo;Give your daughter to my son as wife&rsquo;; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle. "
21879,11554,1,2Chr,25019,"Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall &ndash; you and Judah with you?&rdquo; "
21880,11555,1,2Chr,25020,"But Amaziah would not heed, for it came from God, that He might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought the gods of Edom. "
21881,11556,1,2Chr,25021,"So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. "
21882,11557,1,2Chr,25022,"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. "
21883,11558,1,2Chr,25023,"Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate &ndash; four hundred cubits. "
21884,11559,1,2Chr,25024,"And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria. "
21885,11560,1,2Chr,25025,"Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. "
21886,11561,1,2Chr,25026,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? "
21887,11562,1,2Chr,25027,"After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. "
21888,11563,1,2Chr,25028,Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah. 
21889,11564,1,2Chr,26001,"Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah,* who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. "
21890,11565,1,2Chr,26002,"He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers. "
21891,11566,1,2Chr,26003,"Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. "

21893,11568,1,2Chr,26005,"He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper. "
21894,11569,1,2Chr,26006,"Now he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines. "
21895,11570,1,2Chr,26007,"God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and against the Meunites. "
21896,11571,1,2Chr,26008,"Also the Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong. "
21897,11572,1,2Chr,26009,"And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner buttress of the wall; then he fortified them. "
21898,11573,1,2Chr,26010,"Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil. "
21899,11574,1,2Chr,26011,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies, according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king&rsquo;s captains. "
21900,11575,1,2Chr,26012,The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.

21902,11577,1,2Chr,26014,"Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings to cast stones. "
21903,11578,1,2Chr,26015,"And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong. "
21904,11579,1,2Chr,26016,"But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord his God by entering the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. "

21970,11645,1,2Chr,29023,"Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. "
21971,11646,1,2Chr,29024,"And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make an atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel. "
21972,11647,1,2Chr,29025,"And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king&rsquo;s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus was the commandment of the Lord by his prophets. "

22142,12169,1,Neh,4009,"Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night. "
22143,12170,1,Neh,4010,"Then Judah said, &ldquo;The strength of the laborers is failing, and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.&rdquo; "

22145,12172,1,Neh,4012,"So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, &ldquo;From whatever place you turn, they will be upon us.&rdquo; "
22146,12173,1,Neh,4013,"Therefore I positioned men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. "
22147,12174,1,Neh,4014,"And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, &ldquo;Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.&rdquo; "
22148,12175,1,Neh,4015,"And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. "
22149,12176,1,Neh,4016,"So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor; and the leaders were behind all the house of Judah. "
22150,12177,1,Neh,4017,"Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon. "
22151,12178,1,Neh,4018,Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me. 
22152,12179,1,Neh,4019,"Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, &ldquo;The work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall. "
22153,12180,1,Neh,4020,"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.&rdquo; "
22154,12181,1,Neh,4021,"So we labored in the work, and half of the men held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared. "
22155,12182,1,Neh,4022,"At the same time I also said to the people, &ldquo;Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.&rdquo; "
22156,12183,1,Neh,4023,"So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, except that everyone took them off for washing. "
22157,12184,1,Neh,5001,And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren. 
22158,12185,1,Neh,5002,"For there were those who said, &ldquo;We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.&rdquo; "
22159,12186,1,Neh,5003,"There were also some who said, &ldquo;We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.&rdquo; "
22160,12187,1,Neh,5004,"There were also those who said, &ldquo;We have borrowed money for the king&rsquo;s tax on our lands and vineyards. "
22161,12188,1,Neh,5005,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It is not in our power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards.&rdquo; "
22162,12189,1,Neh,5006,And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. 
22163,12190,1,Neh,5007,"After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, &ldquo;Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.&rdquo; So I called a great assembly against them. "
22164,12191,1,Neh,5008,"And I said to them, &ldquo;According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?&rdquo; Then they were silenced and found nothing to say. "
22165,12192,1,Neh,5009,"Then I said, &ldquo;What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? "
22166,12193,1,Neh,5010,"I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury! "
22167,12194,1,Neh,5011,"Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.&rdquo; "
22168,12195,1,Neh,5012,"So they said, &ldquo;We will restore it, and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.&rdquo; Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. "
22169,12196,1,Neh,5013,"Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, &ldquo;So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.&rdquo; And all the assembly said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; and praised the Lord. Then the people did according to this promise. "
22170,12197,1,Neh,5014,"Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor&rsquo;s provisions. "
22171,12198,1,Neh,5015,"But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God. "
22172,12199,1,Neh,5016,"Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants were gathered there for the work. "
22173,12200,1,Neh,5017,"And at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us. "
22174,12201,1,Neh,5018,"Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor&rsquo;s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people. "
22175,12202,1,Neh,5019,"Remember me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. "
22176,12203,1,Neh,6001,"Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates), "
22177,12204,1,Neh,6002,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, &ldquo;Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono.&rdquo; But they thought to do me harm. "
22178,12205,1,Neh,6003,"So I sent messengers to them, saying, &ldquo;I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?&rdquo; "
22179,12206,1,Neh,6004,"But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner. "
22180,12207,1,Neh,6005,"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. "
22181,12208,1,Neh,6006,"In it was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king. "
22182,12209,1,Neh,6007,"And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, &ldquo;There is a king in Judah!&rdquo; Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together. "
22183,12210,1,Neh,6008,"Then I sent to him, saying, &ldquo;No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.&rdquo; "
22184,12211,1,Neh,6009,"For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, &ldquo;Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done. &ldquo;Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. "
22185,12212,1,Neh,6010,"Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was a secret informer; and he said, &ldquo;Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.&rdquo; "
22186,12213,1,Neh,6011,"And I said, &ldquo;Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!&rdquo; "
22187,12214,1,Neh,6012,"Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. "
22188,12215,1,Neh,6013,"For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so that they might have cause for an evil report, that they might reproach me. "
22189,12216,1,Neh,6014,"My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid. "
22190,12217,1,Neh,6015,"So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days. "
22191,12218,1,Neh,6016,"And it happened, when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations around us saw these things, that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God. "
22192,12219,1,Neh,6017,"Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them. "
22193,12220,1,Neh,6018,"For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. "
22194,12221,1,Neh,6019,"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me. "
22195,12222,1,Neh,7001,"Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, "
22196,12223,1,Neh,7002,"that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the leader of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. "
22197,12224,1,Neh,7003,"And I said to them, &ldquo;Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station and another in front of his own house.&rdquo; "
22198,12225,1,Neh,7004,"Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt. "
22199,12226,1,Neh,7005,"Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return, and found written in it: "

22380,12501,1,Esth,1001,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this was the Ahasuerus who reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India to Ethiopia), "

22384,12505,1,Esth,1005,"And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel, from great to small, in the court of the garden of the king&rsquo;s palace. "
22385,12506,1,Esth,1006,"There were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars; and the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, turquoise, and white and black marble. "
22386,12507,1,Esth,1007,"And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from the other, with royal wine in abundance, according to the generosity of the king. "
22387,12508,1,Esth,1008,"In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according to each man&rsquo;s pleasure. "
22388,12509,1,Esth,1009,Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus. 
22389,12510,1,Esth,1010,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, "

22391,12512,1,Esth,1012,"But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king&rsquo;s command brought by his eunuchs; therefore the king was furious, and his anger burned within him. "
22392,12513,1,Esth,1013,"Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times (for this was the king&rsquo;s manner toward all who knew law and justice, "
22393,12514,1,Esth,1014,"those closest to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king&rsquo;s presence, and who ranked highest in the kingdom): "
22394,12515,1,Esth,1015,"What shall we do to Queen Vashti, according to law, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the eunuchs? "
22395,12516,1,Esth,1016,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: &ldquo;Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes, and all the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. "
22396,12517,1,Esth,1017,"For the queen&rsquo;s behavior will become known to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when they report, &lsquo;King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come.&rsquo; "
22397,12518,1,Esth,1018,"This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king&rsquo;s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath. "
22398,12519,1,Esth,1019,"If it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it will not be altered, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.

22399,12520,1,Esth,1020,"When the king&rsquo;s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.&rdquo; "
22400,12521,1,Esth,1021,"And the reply pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan. "
22401,12522,1,Esth,1022,"Then he sent letters to all the king&rsquo;s provinces, to each province in its own script, and to every people in their own language, that each man should be master in his own house, and speak in the language of his own people. "
22402,12523,1,Esth,2001,"After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her. "
22403,12524,1,Esth,2002,"Then the king&rsquo;s servants who attended him said: &ldquo;Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king; "
22404,12525,1,Esth,2003,"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women&rsquo;s quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king&rsquo;s eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given them. "
22405,12526,1,Esth,2004,"Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.&rdquo; This thing pleased the king, and he did so. "
22406,12527,1,Esth,2005,"In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite. "

22408,12529,1,Esth,2007,"And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle&rsquo;s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was lovely and beautiful. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter. "
22409,12530,1,Esth,2008,"So it was, when the king&rsquo;s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel, under the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king&rsquo;s palace, into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women. "
22410,12531,1,Esth,2009,"Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily gave beauty preparations to her, besides her allowance. Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king&rsquo;s palace, and he moved her and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women. "
22411,12532,1,Esth,2010,"Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal it. "
22412,12533,1,Esth,2011,"And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women&rsquo;s quarters, to learn of Esther&rsquo;s welfare and what was happening to her. "
22413,12534,1,Esth,2012,"Each young woman&rsquo;s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months&rsquo; preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women. "
22414,12535,1,Esth,2013,"Thus prepared, each young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women&rsquo;s quarters to the king&rsquo;s palace. "
22415,12536,1,Esth,2014,"In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king&rsquo;s eunuch who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name. "
22416,12537,1,Esth,2015,"Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king&rsquo;s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her. "
22417,12538,1,Esth,2016,"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. "
22418,12539,1,Esth,2017,"The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. "
22419,12540,1,Esth,2018,"Then the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his officials and servants; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the generosity of a king. "
22420,12541,1,Esth,2019,"When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within the king&rsquo;s gate. "
22421,12542,1,Esth,2020,"Now Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him. "
22422,12543,1,Esth,2021,"In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king&rsquo;s gate, two of the king&rsquo;s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. "
22423,12544,1,Esth,2022,"So the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai&rsquo;s name. "
22424,12545,1,Esth,2023,"And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king. "
22425,12546,1,Esth,3001,"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. "
22426,12547,1,Esth,3002,"And all the king&rsquo;s servants who were within the king&rsquo;s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage. "
22427,12548,1,Esth,3003,"Then the king&rsquo;s servants who were within the king&rsquo;s gate said to Mordecai, &ldquo;Why do you transgress the king&rsquo;s command?&rdquo; "
22428,12549,1,Esth,3004,"Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told it to Haman, to see whether Mordecai&rsquo;s words would stand; for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew. "
22429,12550,1,Esth,3005,"When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with wrath. "
22430,12551,1,Esth,3006,"But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus &ndash; the people of Mordecai. "
22431,12552,1,Esth,3007,"In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot), before Haman to determine the day and the month, F6 until it fell on the twelfth month, F7 which is the month of Adar. "
22432,12553,1,Esth,3008,"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, &ldquo;There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from all other people&rsquo;s, and they do not keep the king&rsquo;s laws. Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain. "
22433,12554,1,Esth,3009,"If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring it into the king&rsquo;s treasuries.&rdquo; "
22434,12555,1,Esth,3010,"So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. "
22435,12556,1,Esth,3011,"And the king said to Haman, &ldquo;The money and the people are given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.&rdquo; "
22436,12557,1,Esth,3012,"Then the king&rsquo;s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded &ndash; to the king&rsquo;s satraps, to the governors who were over each province, to the officials of all people, to every province according to its script, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king&rsquo;s signet ring. "
22437,12558,1,Esth,3013,"And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king&rsquo;s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions."
22438,12559,1,Esth,3014,"A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day. "
22439,12560,1,Esth,3015,"The couriers went out, hastened by the king&rsquo;s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed. "
22440,12561,1,Esth,4001,"When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city. He cried out with a loud and bitter cry. "
22441,12562,1,Esth,4002,"He went as far as the front of the king&rsquo;s gate, for no one might enter the king&rsquo;s gate clothed with sackcloth. "
22442,12563,1,Esth,4003,"And in every province where the king&rsquo;s command and decree arrived, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. "
22443,12564,1,Esth,4004,"So Esther&rsquo;s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept them. "
22444,12565,1,Esth,4005,"Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king&rsquo;s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was. "
22445,12566,1,Esth,4006,"So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king&rsquo;s gate. "
22446,12567,1,Esth,4007,"And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king&rsquo;s treasuries to destroy the Jews. "
22447,12656,1,Esth,9024,"because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them, and had cast Pur (that is, the lot), to consume them and destroy them; "
22448,12657,1,Esth,9025,"but when Esther F14 came before the king, he commanded by letter that this F15 wicked plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. "
22449,12658,1,Esth,9026,"So they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had happened to them, "
22450,12659,1,Esth,9027,"the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year, according to the written instructions and according to the prescribed time, "

22513,12908,1,Job,11002,"&ldquo;Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be vindicated?"
22514,12909,1,Job,11003,"Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one rebuke you?"
22515,12910,1,Job,11004,"For you have said, &lsquo;My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in your eyes.&rsquo;"
22516,12911,1,Job,11005,"But oh, that God would speak, And open His lips against you,"
22517,12912,1,Job,11006,That He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For they would double your prudence. Know therefore that God exacts from you Less than your iniquity deserves.
22518,12913,1,Job,11007,"&ldquo;Can you search out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?"
22519,12914,1,Job,11008,"They are higher than heaven &ndash; what can you do? Deeper than Sheol &ndash; what can you know?"
22520,12915,1,Job,11009,Their measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea.
22521,12916,1,Job,11010,"&ldquo;If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers to judgment, Then who can hinder Him?"
22522,12917,1,Job,11011,"For He knows deceitful men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it?"
22523,12918,1,Job,11012,"For an empty-headed man will be wise, When a wild donkey&rsquo;s colt is born a man."
22524,12919,1,Job,11013,"&ldquo;If you would prepare your heart, And stretch out your hands toward Him;"
22525,12920,1,Job,11014,"If iniquity were in your hand, and you put it far away, And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents;"
22526,12921,1,Job,11015,"Then surely you could lift up your face without spot; Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear;"
22527,12922,1,Job,11016,"Because you would forget your misery, And remember it as waters that have passed away,"
22528,12923,1,Job,11017,"And your life would be brighter than noonday. Though you were dark, you would be like the morning."
22529,12924,1,Job,11018,"And you would be secure, because there is hope; Yes, you would dig around you, and take your rest in safety."
22530,12925,1,Job,11019,"You would also lie down, and no one would make you afraid; Yes, many would court your favor."
22531,12926,1,Job,11020,"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they shall not escape, And their hope &ndash; loss of life!&rdquo;"
22532,12927,1,Job,12001,Then Job answered and said:
22533,12928,1,Job,12002,"&ldquo;No doubt you are the people, And wisdom will die with you!"
22534,12929,1,Job,12003,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Indeed, who does not know such things as these?"
22535,12930,1,Job,12004,"&ldquo;I am one mocked by his friends, Who called on God, and He answered him, The just and blameless who is ridiculed."
22536,12931,1,Job,12005,"A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease; It is made ready for those whose feet slip."
22537,12932,1,Job,12006,"The tents of robbers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure &ndash; In what God provides by His hand."
22538,12933,1,Job,12007,"&ldquo;But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; And the birds of the air, and they will tell you;"
22539,12934,1,Job,12008,"Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; And the fish of the sea will explain to you."
22540,12935,1,Job,12009,"Who among all these does not know That the hand of the Lord has done this,"
22541,12936,1,Job,12010,"In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?"
22542,12937,1,Job,12011,Does not the ear test words And the mouth taste its food?
22543,12938,1,Job,12012,"Wisdom is with aged men, And with length of days, understanding."
22544,13033,1,Job,15032,"It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green."
22545,13034,1,Job,15033,"He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine, And cast off his blossom like an olive tree."
22546,13035,1,Job,15034,"For the company of hypocrites will be barren, And fire will consume the tents of bribery."
22547,13036,1,Job,15035,"They conceive trouble and bring forth futility; Their womb prepares deceit.&rdquo;"
22548,13037,1,Job,16001,Then Job answered and said:
22549,13038,1,Job,16002,"&ldquo;I have heard many such things; Miserable comforters are you all!"
22550,13039,1,Job,16003,Shall words of wind have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
22551,13040,1,Job,16004,"I also could speak as you do, If your soul were in my soul&rsquo;s place. I could heap up words against you, And shake my head at you;"
22552,13041,1,Job,16005,"But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the comfort of my lips would relieve your grief."
22553,13042,1,Job,16006,"&ldquo;Though I speak, my grief is not relieved; And if I remain silent, how am I eased?"
22554,13043,1,Job,16007,"But now He has worn me out; You have made desolate all my company."
22555,13044,1,Job,16008,"You have shriveled me up, And it is a witness against me; My leanness rises up against me And bears witness to my face."
22556,13045,1,Job,16009,"He tears me in His wrath, and hates me; He gnashes at me with His teeth; My adversary sharpens His gaze on me. "
22557,13046,1,Job,16010,"They gape at me with their mouth, They strike me reproachfully on the cheek, They gather together against me."
22558,13047,1,Job,16011,"God has delivered me to the ungodly, And turned me over to the hands of the wicked."
22559,13048,1,Job,16012,"I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He also has taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces; He has set me up for His target,"
22560,13049,1,Job,16013,"His archers surround me. He pierces my heart and does not pity; He pours out my gall on the ground."
22561,13050,1,Job,16014,"He breaks me with wound upon wound; He runs at me like a warrior."
22562,13051,1,Job,16015,"&ldquo;I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, And laid my head in the dust."
22563,13052,1,Job,16016,"My face is flushed from weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
22564,13053,1,Job,16017,"Although no violence is in my hands, And my prayer is pure."
22565,13054,1,Job,16018,"&ldquo;O earth, do not cover my blood, And let my cry have no resting place!"
22566,13055,1,Job,16019,"Surely even now my witness is in heaven, And my evidence is on high."
22567,13056,1,Job,16020,"My friends scorn me; My eyes pour out tears to God."
22568,13057,1,Job,16021,"Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, As a man pleads for his neighbor!"
22569,13058,1,Job,16022,"For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of no return."
22570,13059,1,Job,17001,"&ldquo;My spirit is broken, My days are extinguished, The grave is ready for me."
22571,13060,1,Job,17002,Are not mockers with me? And does not my eye dwell on their provocation?
22572,13061,1,Job,17003,"&ldquo;Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who is he who will shake hands with me?"
22573,13062,1,Job,17004,"For You have hidden their heart from understanding; Therefore You will not exalt them."
22574,13063,1,Job,17005,"He who speaks flattery to his friends, Even the eyes of his children will fail."
22575,13064,1,Job,17006,"&ldquo;But He has made me a byword of the people, And I have become one in whose face men spit."
22576,13065,1,Job,17007,"My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow, And all my members are like shadows."
22577,13066,1,Job,17008,"Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite."
22578,13067,1,Job,17009,"Yet the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger."
22579,13068,1,Job,17010,"&ldquo;But please, come back again, all of you, For I shall not find one wise man among you."
22580,13069,1,Job,17011,"My days are past, My purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart."
22581,13070,1,Job,17012,"They change the night into day; &lsquo;The light is near,&rsquo; they say, in the face of darkness."
22582,13071,1,Job,17013,"If I wait for the grave as my house, If I make my bed in the darkness,"
22583,13072,1,Job,17014,"If I say to corruption, &lsquo;You are my father,&rsquo; And to the worm, &lsquo;You are my mother and my sister,&rsquo;"
22584,13073,1,Job,17015,"Where then is my hope? As for my hope, who can see it?"
22585,13074,1,Job,17016,"Will they go down to the gates of Sheol? Shall we have rest together in the dust?&rdquo;"
22586,13075,1,Job,18001,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
22587,13076,1,Job,18002,"&ldquo;How long till you put an end to words? Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak."
22588,13077,1,Job,18003,"Why are we counted as beasts, And regarded as stupid in your sight?"
22589,13078,1,Job,18004,"You who tear yourself in anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed from its place?"
22590,13079,1,Job,18005,"&ldquo;The light of the wicked indeed goes out, And the flame of his fire does not shine."
22591,13080,1,Job,18006,"The light is dark in his tent, And his lamp beside him is put out. "
22592,13081,1,Job,18007,"The steps of his strength are shortened, And his own counsel casts him down."
22593,13082,1,Job,18008,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walks into a snare."
22594,13083,1,Job,18009,"The net takes him by the heel, And a snare lays hold of him."
22595,13084,1,Job,18010,"A noose is hidden for him on the ground, And a trap for him in the road."
22596,13085,1,Job,18011,"Terrors frighten him on every side, And drive him to his feet."
22597,13086,1,Job,18012,"His strength is starved, And destruction is ready at his side."
22598,13087,1,Job,18013,"It devours patches of his skin; The firstborn of death devours his limbs."
22599,13088,1,Job,18014,"He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent, And they parade him before the king of terrors."
22600,13089,1,Job,18015,"They dwell in his tent who are none of his; Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling."
22601,13090,1,Job,18016,"His roots are dried out below, And his branch withers above."
22602,13091,1,Job,18017,"The memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name among the renowned."
22603,13092,1,Job,18018,"He is driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world."
22604,13093,1,Job,18019,"He has neither son nor posterity among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings."
22605,13094,1,Job,18020,"Those in the west are astonished at his day, As those in the east are frightened."
22606,13095,1,Job,18021,"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God.&rdquo;"
22607,13096,1,Job,19001,Then Job answered and said:
22608,13097,1,Job,19002,"&ldquo;How long will you torment my soul, And break me in pieces with words?"
22609,13098,1,Job,19003,"These ten times you have reproached me; You are not ashamed that you have wronged me."
22610,13099,1,Job,19004,"And if indeed I have erred, My error remains with me."
22611,13100,1,Job,19005,"If indeed you exalt yourselves against me, And plead my disgrace against me,"
22612,13101,1,Job,19006,"Know then that God has wronged me, And has surrounded me with His net."
22613,13102,1,Job,19007,"&ldquo;If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard. If I cry aloud, there is no justice."
22614,13103,1,Job,19008,"He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass; And He has set darkness in my paths."
22615,13104,1,Job,19009,"He has stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head."
22616,13105,1,Job,19010,"He breaks me down on every side, And I am gone; My hope He has uprooted like a tree."
22617,13106,1,Job,19011,"He has also kindled His wrath against me, And He counts me as one of His enemies."
22618,13107,1,Job,19012,"His troops come together And build up their road against me; They encamp all around my tent."
22619,13108,1,Job,19013,"&ldquo;He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me."
22620,13109,1,Job,19014,"My relatives have failed, And my close friends have forgotten me."
22621,13110,1,Job,19015,"Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants, Count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight."
22622,13111,1,Job,19016,"I call my servant, but he gives no answer; I beg him with my mouth."
22623,13112,1,Job,19017,"My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am repulsive to the children of my own body."
22624,13113,1,Job,19018,"Even young children despise me; I arise, and they speak against me."
22625,13114,1,Job,19019,"All my close friends abhor me, And those whom I love have turned against me."
22626,13115,1,Job,19020,"My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth."
22627,13116,1,Job,19021,"&ldquo;Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me!"
22628,13117,1,Job,19022,"Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh?"
22629,13118,1,Job,19023,"&ldquo;Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!"
22630,13119,1,Job,19024,"That they were engraved on a rock With an iron pen and lead, forever!"
22631,13120,1,Job,19025,"For I know that my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth;"
22632,13121,1,Job,19026,"And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God,"
22633,13122,1,Job,19027,"Whom I shall see for myself, And my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!"
22634,13123,1,Job,19028,"If you should say, &lsquo;How shall we persecute him?&rsquo; &ndash; Since the root of the matter is found in me,"
22635,13124,1,Job,19029,"Be afraid of the sword for yourselves; For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, That you may know there is a judgment.&rdquo;"
22636,13125,1,Job,20001,Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
22637,13218,1,Job,23001,Then Job answered and said:
22638,13219,1,Job,23002,"&ldquo;Even today my complaint is bitter; My hand is listless because of my groaning."
22639,13220,1,Job,23003,"Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!"
22640,13221,1,Job,23004,"I would present my case before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments."
22641,13222,1,Job,23005,"I would know the words which He would answer me, And understand what He would say to me."
22642,13223,1,Job,23006,Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would take note of me.
22643,13224,1,Job,23007,"There the upright could reason with Him, And I would be delivered forever from my Judge."
22644,13225,1,Job,23008,"&ldquo;Look, I go forward, but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;"
22645,13226,1,Job,23009,"When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold Him; When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see Him."
22646,13227,1,Job,23010,"But He knows the way that I take; When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold."
22647,13228,1,Job,23011,"My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside."
22648,13229,1,Job,23012,"I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food."
22649,13230,1,Job,23013,"&ldquo;But He is unique, and who can make Him change? And whatever His soul desires, that He does."
22650,13231,1,Job,23014,"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such things are with Him."
22651,13232,1,Job,23015,"Therefore I am terrified at His presence; When I consider this, I am afraid of Him."
22652,13233,1,Job,23016,"For God made my heart weak, And the Almighty terrifies me;"
22653,13234,1,Job,23017,"Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness, And He did not hide deep darkness from my face."
22654,13235,1,Job,24001,"&ldquo;Since times are not hidden from the Almighty, Why do those who know Him see not His days?"
22655,13236,1,Job,24002,"&ldquo;Some remove landmarks; They seize flocks violently and feed on them;"
22656,13237,1,Job,24003,"They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow&rsquo;s ox as a pledge."
22657,13238,1,Job,24004,"They push the needy off the road; All the poor of the land are forced to hide."
22658,13239,1,Job,24005,"Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, They go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness yields food for them and for their children."
22659,13240,1,Job,24006,They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
22660,13241,1,Job,24007,"They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering in the cold."
22661,13242,1,Job,24008,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And huddle around the rock for want of shelter."
22662,13243,1,Job,24009,"&ldquo;Some snatch the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge from the poor."
22663,13244,1,Job,24010,"They cause the poor to go naked, without clothing; And they take away the sheaves from the hungry."
22664,13245,1,Job,24011,"They press out oil within their walls, And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst."
22665,13246,1,Job,24012,"The dying groan in the city, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not charge them with wrong."
22666,13247,1,Job,24013,"&ldquo;There are those who rebel against the light; They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths."
22667,13248,1,Job,24014,"The murderer rises with the light; He kills the poor and needy; And in the night he is like a thief."
22668,13249,1,Job,24015,"The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, &lsquo;No eye will see me&rsquo;; And he disguises his face."
22669,13250,1,Job,24016,"In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the daytime; They do not know the light."
22670,13251,1,Job,24017,"For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death; If someone recognizes them, They are in the terrors of the shadow of death."
22671,13252,1,Job,24018,"&ldquo;They should be swift on the face of the waters, Their portion should be cursed in the earth, So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards."
22672,13253,1,Job,24019,"As drought and heat consume the snow waters, So the grave consumes those who have sinned."
22673,13254,1,Job,24020,"The womb should forget him, The worm should feed sweetly on him; He should be remembered no more, And wickedness should be broken like a tree."
22674,13255,1,Job,24021,"For he preys on the barren who do not bear, And does no good for the widow."
22675,13256,1,Job,24022,"&ldquo;But God draws the mighty away with His power; He rises up, but no man is sure of life."
22676,13257,1,Job,24023,"He gives them security, and they rely on it; Yet His eyes are on their ways."
22677,13258,1,Job,24024,"They are exalted for a little while, Then they are gone. They are brought low; They are taken out of the way like all others; They dry out like the heads of grain."
22678,13259,1,Job,24025,"&ldquo;Now if it is not so, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech worth nothing?&rdquo;"
22679,13260,1,Job,25001,Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
22680,13261,1,Job,25002,"&ldquo;Dominion and fear belong to Him; He makes peace in His high places."
22681,13262,1,Job,25003,Is there any number to His armies? Upon whom does His light not rise?
22682,13263,1,Job,25004,How then can man be righteous before God? Or how can he be pure who is born of a woman?
22683,13264,1,Job,25005,"If even the moon does not shine, And the stars are not pure in His sight,"
22684,13265,1,Job,25006,"How much less man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, who is a worm?&rdquo;"

23345,14802,1,Isa,6005,"So I said: &ldquo;Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.&rdquo;"
23346,14803,1,Isa,6006,"Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar."
23347,14804,1,Isa,6007,"And he touched my mouth with it, and said: &ldquo;Behold, this has touched your lips; your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.&rdquo;"
23348,14805,1,Isa,6008,"Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: &ldquo;Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;Here am I! Send me.&rdquo; "

23354,14811,1,Isa,7001,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but could not prevail against it."
23355,14812,1,Isa,7002,"And it was told to the house of David, saying, &ldquo;Syria&rsquo;s forces are deployed in Ephraim.&rdquo; So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind."
23356,14813,1,Isa,7003,"Then the Lord said to Isaiah, &ldquo;Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller&rsquo;s Field,"

23362,14819,1,Isa,7009,"The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah&rsquo;s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"

23378,14835,1,Isa,7025,"And to any hill which could be dug with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; but it will become a range for oxen and a place for sheep to roam."
23379,14836,1,Isa,8001,"Moreover the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Take a large scroll, and write on it with a man&rsquo;s pen concerning Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."

23401,14858,1,Isa,9001,"Nevertheless the gloom will not be upon her who is distressed, as when at first He lightly esteemed the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward more heavily oppressed her, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, in Galilee of the Gentiles."

24125,16114,1,Ezek,6003,"&ldquo;and say, &lsquo;O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: &ldquo;Indeed I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places."
24126,16115,1,Ezek,6004,"&ldquo;Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain men before your idols."
24127,16116,1,Ezek,6005,"&ldquo;And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars."
24128,16117,1,Ezek,6006,"&ldquo;In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works ma"

24130,16119,1,Ezek,6008,"&ldquo;Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries."
24131,16120,1,Ezek,6009,"&ldquo;Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has departed from Me, and by their eyes which play the harlot after their idols; they will loathe themse"
24132,16121,1,Ezek,6010,"&ldquo;And they shall know that I am the Lord; I have not said in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.&rdquo;"
24133,16122,1,Ezek,6011,"&lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Pound your fists and stamp your feet, and say, &lsquo;Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."
24134,16123,1,Ezek,6012,"&lsquo;He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them."
24135,16124,1,Ezek,6013,"&lsquo;Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered sweet incense to all their idols"
24136,16211,1,Ezek,11008,"&ldquo;You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24137,16212,1,Ezek,11009,"&ldquo;And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments on you."
24138,16213,1,Ezek,11010,"&ldquo;You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the Lord."

24140,16215,1,Ezek,11012,"&ldquo;And you shall know that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which are all around you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24141,16216,1,Ezek,11013,"Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, &ldquo;Ah, Lord God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?&rdquo;"
24142,16217,1,Ezek,11014,"Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24143,16218,1,Ezek,11015,"&ldquo;Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety, are those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, &lsquo;Get far away from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a possession.&rsquo;"
24144,16219,1,Ezek,11016,"&ldquo;Therefore say, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
24145,16220,1,Ezek,11017,"&ldquo;Therefore say, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
24146,16221,1,Ezek,11018,"&ldquo;And they will go there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there."
24147,16222,1,Ezek,11019,"&ldquo;Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,"
24148,16223,1,Ezek,11020,"&ldquo;that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God."
24149,16224,1,Ezek,11021,"&ldquo;But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds on their own heads,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24150,16225,1,Ezek,11022,"So the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was high above them."
24151,16226,1,Ezek,11023,"And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain, which is on the east side of the city."
24152,16227,1,Ezek,11024,"Then the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me."
24153,16228,1,Ezek,11025,So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the Lord had shown me.
24154,16229,1,Ezek,12001,"Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying:"
24155,16230,1,Ezek,12002,"&ldquo;Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which has eyes to see but does not see, and ears to hear but does not hear; for they are a rebellious house."
24156,16231,1,Ezek,12003,"&ldquo;Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for captivity, and go into captivity by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into captivity to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they are a rebellious house."
24157,16232,1,Ezek,12004,"&ldquo;By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity."
24158,16233,1,Ezek,12005,"&ldquo;Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your belongings out through it."
24159,16234,1,Ezek,12006,"&ldquo;In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.&rdquo;"
24160,16235,1,Ezek,12007,"So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought them out at twilight, and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight."
24161,16236,1,Ezek,12008,"And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24162,16237,1,Ezek,12009,"&ldquo;Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, &lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo;"
24163,16238,1,Ezek,12010,"&ldquo;Say to them, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
24164,16239,1,Ezek,12011,"&ldquo;Say, &lsquo;I am a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall be carried away into captivity.&rsquo;"
24165,16240,1,Ezek,12012,"&ldquo;And the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder at twilight and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes."
24166,16241,1,Ezek,12013,"&ldquo;I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there."
24167,16242,1,Ezek,12014,"&ldquo;I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them."
24168,16243,1,Ezek,12015,"&ldquo;Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries."
24169,16244,1,Ezek,12016,"&ldquo;But I will spare a few of their men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles wherever they go. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;"
24170,16245,1,Ezek,12017,"Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24171,16246,1,Ezek,12018,"&ldquo;Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety."
24172,16247,1,Ezek,12019,"&ldquo;And say to the people of the land, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel: &ldquo;They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dread, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, becaus"
24173,16248,1,Ezek,12020,"&ldquo;Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24174,16249,1,Ezek,12021,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24175,16250,1,Ezek,12022,"&ldquo;Son of man, what is this proverb that you people have about the land of Israel, which says, &lsquo;The days are prolonged, and every vision fails&rsquo;?"
24176,16251,1,Ezek,12023,"&ldquo;Tell them therefore, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;I will lay this proverb to rest, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.&rdquo; But say to them, &ldquo;The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision."
24177,16252,1,Ezek,12024,"&ldquo;For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel."
24178,16253,1,Ezek,12025,"&ldquo;For I am the Lord. I speak, and the word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be postponed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and perform it,&rdquo; says the Lord God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24179,16254,1,Ezek,12026,"Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24180,16255,1,Ezek,12027,"&ldquo;Son of man, look, the house of Israel is saying, &lsquo;The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.&rsquo;"
24181,16256,1,Ezek,12028,"&ldquo;Therefore say to them, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;None of My words will be postponed any more, but the word which I speak will be done,&rdquo; says the Lord God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24182,16257,1,Ezek,13001,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24183,16258,1,Ezek,13002,"&ldquo;Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, &lsquo;Hear the word of the Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24184,16259,1,Ezek,13003,"Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!"
24185,16260,1,Ezek,13004,"&ldquo;O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts."
24186,16261,1,Ezek,13005,"&ldquo;You have not gone up into the gaps to build a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle on the day of the Lord."
24187,16262,1,Ezek,13006,"&ldquo;They have envisioned futility and false divination, saying, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord!&rsquo; But the Lord has not sent them; yet they hope that the word may be confirmed."
24188,16263,1,Ezek,13007,"&ldquo;Have you not seen a futile vision, and have you not spoken false divination? You say, &lsquo;The Lord says,&rsquo; but I have not spoken.&rdquo;"
24189,16264,1,Ezek,13008,"Therefore thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Because you have spoken nonsense and envisioned lies, therefore I am indeed against you,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24190,16265,1,Ezek,13009,"&ldquo;My hand will be against the prophets who envision futility and who divine lies; they shall not be in the assembly of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I "
24191,16266,1,Ezek,13010,"&ldquo;Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, &lsquo;Peace!&rsquo; when there is no peace &ndash; and one builds a wall, and they plaster it with untempered mortar &ndash; "
24192,16267,1,Ezek,13011,"&ldquo;say to those who plaster it with untempered mortar, that it will fall. There will be flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall tear it down."
24193,16268,1,Ezek,13012,"&ldquo;Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, &lsquo;Where is the mortar with which you plastered it?&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24194,16269,1,Ezek,13013,"Therefore thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it."
24195,16270,1,Ezek,13014,"&ldquo;So I will break down the wall you have plastered with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. Then you shall know that I am the Lord."
24196,16271,1,Ezek,13015,"&ldquo;Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, &lsquo;The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it,"
24197,16272,1,Ezek,13016,"&lsquo;that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,&rsquo;&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24198,16273,1,Ezek,13017,"&ldquo;Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,"
24199,16274,1,Ezek,13018,"&ldquo;and say, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive?"
24200,16275,1,Ezek,13019,"&ldquo;And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?&rdquo;"
24201,16276,1,Ezek,13020,"&lsquo;Therefore thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Behold, I am against your magic charms by which you hunt souls there like birds. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt like birds."
24202,16277,1,Ezek,13021,"&ldquo;I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. Then you shall know that I am the Lord."
24203,16278,1,Ezek,13022,"&ldquo;Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life."
24204,16279,1,Ezek,13023,"&ldquo;Therefore you shall no longer envision futility nor practice divination; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24205,16280,1,Ezek,14001,Now some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
24206,16281,1,Ezek,14002,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24207,16282,1,Ezek,14003,"&ldquo;Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity. Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them?"

24211,16286,1,Ezek,14007,"&ldquo;For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, then comes to a prophet to inquire of him concernin"
24212,16287,1,Ezek,14008,"&ldquo;I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. Then you shall know that I am the Lord."
24213,16288,1,Ezek,14009,"&ldquo;And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I the Lord have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel."
24214,16289,1,Ezek,14010,"&ldquo;And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired,"
24215,16290,1,Ezek,14011,"&ldquo;that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God,&rdquo; says the Lord God.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24216,16291,1,Ezek,14012,"The word of the Lord came again to me, saying:"
24217,16292,1,Ezek,14013,"&ldquo;Son of man, when a land sins against Me by persistent unfaithfulness, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of bread, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it."
24218,16293,1,Ezek,14014,"&ldquo;Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24219,16294,1,Ezek,14015,"&ldquo;If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they empty it, and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts,"
24220,16295,1,Ezek,14016,"&ldquo;even though these three men were in it, as I live,&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered, and the land would be desolate."
24221,16296,1,Ezek,14017,"&ldquo;Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, &lsquo;Sword, go through the land,&rsquo; and I cut off man and beast from it,"
24222,16297,1,Ezek,14018,"&ldquo;even though these three men were in it, as I live,&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered."
24223,16298,1,Ezek,14019,"&ldquo;Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast,"
24224,16299,1,Ezek,14020,"&ldquo;even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live,&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.&rdquo;"
24225,16300,1,Ezek,14021,"For thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;How much more it shall be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem &ndash; the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence &ndash; to cut off man and beast from it?"
24226,16301,1,Ezek,14022,"&ldquo;Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the disaster that I have brought upon "

24229,16304,1,Ezek,15002,"&ldquo;Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?"
24230,16305,1,Ezek,15003,"&ldquo;Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it to hang any vessel on?"
24231,16306,1,Ezek,15004,"&ldquo;Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?"
24232,16307,1,Ezek,15005,"&ldquo;Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?"
24233,16308,1,Ezek,15006,"&ldquo;Therefore thus says the Lord God: &lsquo;Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;"
24234,16309,1,Ezek,15007,"&lsquo;and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when I set My face against them."
24235,16310,1,Ezek,15008,"&lsquo;Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,&rsquo; says the Lord God.&rdquo;"

24239,16314,1,Ezek,16004,"&ldquo;As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths."
24240,16315,1,Ezek,16005,"&ldquo;No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were loathed on the day you were born."
24241,16316,1,Ezek,16006,"&ldquo;And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, &lsquo;Live!&rsquo; Yes, I said to you in your blood, &lsquo;Live!&rsquo;"
24242,16317,1,Ezek,16007,"&ldquo;I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare."
24243,16318,1,Ezek,16008,"&ldquo;When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24244,16319,1,Ezek,16009,"&ldquo;Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed off your blood, and I anointed you with oil."
24245,16320,1,Ezek,16010,"&ldquo;I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk."
24246,16321,1,Ezek,16011,"&ldquo;I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck."
24247,16322,1,Ezek,16012,"&ldquo;And I put a jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head."
24248,16323,1,Ezek,16013,"&ldquo;Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate pastry of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty."
24249,16324,1,Ezek,16014,"&ldquo;Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24250,16325,1,Ezek,16015,"&ldquo;But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it."
24251,16326,1,Ezek,16016,"&ldquo;You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and played the harlot on them. Such things should not happen, nor be."
24252,16327,1,Ezek,16017,"&ldquo;You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them."
24253,16328,1,Ezek,16018,"&ldquo;You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them."
24254,16329,1,Ezek,16019,"&ldquo;Also My food which I gave you &ndash; the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you &ndash; you set it before them as sweet incense; and so it was,&rdquo; says the Lord God."
24255,16330,1,Ezek,16020,"&ldquo;Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter,"
24256,16331,1,Ezek,16021,"&ldquo;that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?"
24257,16332,1,Ezek,16022,"&ldquo;And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood."
24258,16333,1,Ezek,16023,"&ldquo;Then it was so, after all your wickedness &ndash; &lsquo;Woe, woe to you!&rsquo; says the Lord God &ndash; "
24259,16334,1,Ezek,16024,"&ldquo;that you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself in every street."
24260,16335,1,Ezek,16025,"&ldquo;You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry."
24261,16336,1,Ezek,16026,"&ldquo;You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger."
24262,16337,1,Ezek,16027,"&ldquo;Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior."
24263,16338,1,Ezek,16028,"&ldquo;You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied."
24264,16339,1,Ezek,16029,"&ldquo;Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied."
24265,16340,1,Ezek,16030,"&ldquo;How degenerate is your heart!&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;seeing you do all these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot."
24266,16341,1,Ezek,16031,"&ldquo;You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment."
24267,16342,1,Ezek,16032,"&ldquo;You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband."
24268,16343,1,Ezek,16033,"&ldquo;Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your lovers, and hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry."
24269,16344,1,Ezek,16034,"&ldquo;You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.&rdquo;"
24270,16345,1,Ezek,16035,"&lsquo;Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord!"
24271,16346,1,Ezek,16036,"&lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,"
24272,16347,1,Ezek,16037,"&ldquo;surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness."
24273,16348,1,Ezek,16038,"&ldquo;And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy."
24274,16349,1,Ezek,16039,"&ldquo;I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare."
24275,16350,1,Ezek,16040,"&ldquo;They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords."
24276,16351,1,Ezek,16041,"&ldquo;They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you shall no longer hire lovers."
24277,16352,1,Ezek,16042,"&ldquo;So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more."
24278,16353,1,Ezek,16043,"&ldquo;Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds on your own head,&rdquo; says the Lord God. &ldquo;And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your abominations."
24279,16354,1,Ezek,16044,"&ldquo;Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you: &lsquo;Like mother, like daughter!&rsquo;"
24280,16355,1,Ezek,16045,"&ldquo;You are your mother&rsquo;s daughter, loathing husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children; your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite."
24281,16356,1,Ezek,16046,"&ldquo;Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters."
24282,16357,1,Ezek,16047,"&ldquo;You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways."
24283,16358,1,Ezek,16048,"&ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done."
24284,16359,1,Ezek,16049,"&ldquo;Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."
24285,16360,1,Ezek,16050,"&ldquo;And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit."
24286,16361,1,Ezek,16051,"&ldquo;Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done."

24290,16365,1,Ezek,16055,"&ldquo;When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state."
24291,16366,1,Ezek,16056,"&ldquo;For your sister Sodom was not a byword in your mouth in the days of your pride,"
24292,16367,1,Ezek,16057,"&ldquo;before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you everywhere."
24293,16368,1,Ezek,16058,"&ldquo;You have paid for your lewdness and your abominations,&rdquo; says the Lord."
24294,16369,1,Ezek,16059,"&lsquo;For thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;I will deal with you as you have done, who despised the oath by breaking the covenant."
24295,16370,1,Ezek,16060,"&ldquo;Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you."
24296,16371,1,Ezek,16061,"&ldquo;Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; for I will give them to you for daughters, but not because of My covenant with you."
24297,16372,1,Ezek,16062,"&ldquo;And I will establish My covenant with you. Then you shall know that I am the Lord,"

24302,16377,1,Ezek,17004,"He cropped off its topmost young twig And carried it to a land of trade; He set it in a city of merchants."
24303,16378,1,Ezek,17005,"Then he took some of the seed of the land And planted it in a fertile field; He placed it by abundant waters And set it like a willow tree."
24304,16379,1,Ezek,17006,"And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; Its branches turned toward him, But its roots were under it. So it became a vine, Brought forth branches, And put forth shoots."
24305,16380,1,Ezek,17007,"&ldquo;But there was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, And stretched its branches toward him, From the garden terrace where it had been planted, That he might water it."
24306,16381,1,Ezek,17008,"It was planted in good soil by many waters, To bring forth branches, bear fruit, And become a majestic vine.&rdquo;&rsquo;"
24307,16382,1,Ezek,17009,"&ldquo;Say, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, Cut off its fruit, And leave it to wither? All of its spring leaves will wither, And no great power or many people Will be needed to pluck it up by its roots. "
24308,16383,1,Ezek,17010,"Behold, it is planted, Will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the garden terrace where it grew.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24309,16384,1,Ezek,17011,"Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"
24310,16385,1,Ezek,17012,"&ldquo;Say now to the rebellious house: &lsquo;Do you not know what these things mean?&rsquo; Tell them, &lsquo;Indeed the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and took its king and princes, and led them with him to Babylon."
24311,16386,1,Ezek,17013,"&lsquo;And he took the king&rsquo;s offspring, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,"

24316,16391,1,Ezek,17018,"&lsquo;Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave his hand and still did all these things, he shall not escape.&rsquo;&rdquo;"
24317,16392,1,Ezek,17019,"Therefore thus says the Lord God: &ldquo;As I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense on his own head."

25134,17415,1,Jonah,1008,"Then they said to him, &ldquo;Tell us, on whose account this evil has come upon us? What is your occupation? And whence do you come? What is your country? And of what people are you?&rdquo;"
25135,17416,1,Jonah,1009,"And he said to them, &ldquo;I am a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.&rdquo;"
25136,17417,1,Jonah,1010,"Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, &ldquo;What is this that you have done!&rdquo; For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them."
25137,17418,1,Jonah,1011,"Then they said to him, &ldquo;What shall we do to you, that the sea may quite down for us?&rdquo; For the sea grew more and more tempestuous."
25138,17419,1,Jonah,1012,"He said to them, &ldquo;Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you; for I know its because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.&rdquo;"
25139,17420,1,Jonah,1013,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them."
25140,17421,1,Jonah,1014,"Therefore they cried to the Lord, &ldquo;We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man&rsquo;s life, and lay noit on us innocent blood; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.&rdquo;"
25141,17422,1,Jonah,1015,"So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging."
25142,17423,1,Jonah,1016,"Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows."
25143,17424,1,Jonah,1017,"And the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."
25144,17425,1,Jonah,2001,"Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish,"
25145,17426,1,Jonah,2002,"saying, &ldquo;I called to the Lord, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and thou didst hear my voice."
25146,17427,1,Jonah,2003,"For thou didst cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all thy waves and thy billows passed over me."
25147,17428,1,Jonah,2004,"Then I said, &lsquo;I am cast out from my presence; how shall I again look upon thy holy temple?&rsquo;"
25148,17429,1,Jonah,2005,"The waters closed in over me, the deep was round about me; weeds were wrapped about my head"
25149,17430,1,Jonah,2006,"at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me for ever; yet thou didst bring up my life from the Pit, O Lord my God."
25150,17431,1,Jonah,2007,"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to thee, into the holy temple."
25151,17432,1,Jonah,2008,Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their true loyalty.
25152,17433,1,Jonah,2009,"But I with the voice of Thanksgiving will sacrifice to thee; what I have vowed I will pay. Deliverance belongs to the Lord!&rdquo;"
25153,17434,1,Jonah,2010,"And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land."
25154,17435,1,Jonah,3001,"Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, saying,"
25155,17436,1,Jonah,3002,"Arise, go to Nin&rsquo;eveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you."
25156,17437,1,Jonah,3003,"So Jonah arose and went to Nin&rsquo;eveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nin&rsquo;eveh was an exceedingly great city, three days&rsquo; journey in breadth."
25157,17438,1,Jonah,3004,"Jonah began to go into the city, going a day&rsquo;s journey. And he cried, &ldquo;yet forty days, Nin&rsquo;eveh shall be overthrown!&rdquo;"
25158,17439,1,Jonah,3005,"And the people of Nin&rsquo;eveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth. From the greatest of them to the least of them."
25159,17440,1,Jonah,3006,"The tidings reached the king of Nin&rsquo;eveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
25160,17441,1,Jonah,3007,"And he made proclamation and published through Nin&rsquo;eveh, &ldquo;By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, or drink water,"
25161,17442,1,Jonah,3008,"but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them cry mightily to God; yea, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence which his is in his hands."
25162,17443,1,Jonah,3009,"Who knows, God may yet repent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we perish not?&rdquo;"
25163,17444,1,Jonah,3010,"When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did not do it."
25164,17445,1,Jonah,4001,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry."
25165,17446,1,Jonah,4002,"And he prayed to the Lord and said, &ldquo;I pray thee, Lord, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast lo"
25166,17447,1,Jonah,4003,"Therefore now, O Lord, take my life from me, I beseech thee, for it is better for me to die than live.&rdquo;"
25167,17448,1,Jonah,4004,"And the Lord, &ldquo;Do you do well to be angry?&rdquo;"
25168,17449,1,Jonah,4005,"Then Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city, and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in shade, till he should see what would become of the city."
25169,17450,1,Jonah,4006,"And the Lord God appointed a plant, and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant."
25170,17451,1,Jonah,4007,"But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm which attacked the plant, so that it withered."
25171,17452,1,Jonah,4008,"And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah&rsquo;s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, &ldquo;It is better for me to die than to live.&rdquo;"
25172,17453,1,Jonah,4009,"But God said to Jonah, &ldquo;Do you do well to be angry for the plant?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.&rdquo;"
25173,17454,1,Jonah,4010,"And the Lord said, &ldquo;you pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night, and perished in a night."
25174,17455,1,Jonah,4011,"And should I not pity Nin&rsquo;eveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?&rdquo;"
25175,17456,1,Amos,8009,"&ldquo;And it shall come to pass in that day,&rdquo; says the Lord God, &ldquo;That I will make the sun go down at noon, And I will darken the earth in broad daylight;"
25176,17459,1,Amos,8010,"I will turn your feasts into mourning, And all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth on every waist, And baldness on every head; I will make it like mourning for an only son, And its end like a bitter day."
25177,17466,1,Micah,4006,"In that day, declares the LORD, I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief."
25178,17467,1,Micah,4007,"I will make the lame a remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever."
25179,17468,1,Micah,5002,"&ldquo;But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel,    Whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.&rdquo;"
25180,17469,1,Micah,5003,"Therefore He shall give them up, until the time that she who is in labor has given birth; then the remnant of His brethren shall return to the children of Israel."
25181,17470,1,Micah,5004,"And He shall stand and feed His flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD His God; and they shall abide, for now He shall be great to the ends of the earth."
25182,0,0,Rom,14024,"Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages,"
25183,0,0,Rom,14025,"but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations;"
25184,0,0,Rom,14026,"to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen."
